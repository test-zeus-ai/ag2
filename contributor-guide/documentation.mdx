## How to get a notebook rendered on the website

See [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/contributing.md#how-to-get-a-notebook-displayed-on-the-website) for instructions on how to get a notebook in the `notebook` directory rendered on the website.

## Build documentation locally

Follow these steps to build and serve the documentation on your local machine:

1. Install Node.js:
    - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2.  Install Quarto:
    - Visit the Quarto download [page](https://quarto.org/docs/download/).
    - Click on the Pre-release tab and download the latest version of Quarto.
    - Ensure you install version `1.5.23` or higher.

3. Install Required Python Packages:
    - From the project root directory, install the necessary Python packages by running:

        ```console
        pip install -e ".[docs]"
        ```

4. Build and Serve the Documentation:

    - To build and serve the documentation locally, run the following command from the project root directory:

        ```console
        ./scripts/docs_serve.sh
        ```

The last command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build with Dev Containers

To build and test documentation using Dev Containers, open the project using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

This will open the project in a Dev Container with all the required dependencies installed.

Open a terminal and run the following commands to build and serve the documentation:

```console
pip install -e ".[docs]"
./scripts/docs_serve.sh
```

Once done you should be able to access the documentation at `http://localhost:3000/`.
