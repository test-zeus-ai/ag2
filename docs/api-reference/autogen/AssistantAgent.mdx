    (In preview) Assistant agent, designed to solve a task with LLM.
    
    AssistantAgent is a subclass of ConversableAgent configured with a default system message.
    The default system message is designed to solve a task with LLM,
    including suggesting python code blocks and debugging.
    `human_input_mode` is default to "NEVER"
    and `code_execution_config` is default to False.
    This agent doesn't execute code by default, and expects the user to execute the code.

| `llm_config` | llm inference configuration.<br/><br/>Please refer to [OpenAIWrapper.create](/reference/autogen/OpenAIWrapper#create) for available options.<br/><br/>**Type:** `dict \| Literal[False] \| None`<br/><br/>**Default:** None |
| `is_termination_msg` | a function that takes a message in the form of a dictionary and returns a boolean value indicating if this received message is a termination message.<br/><br/>The dict can contain the following keys: "content", "role", "name", "function_call".<br/><br/>**Type:** `Callable[[dict], bool] \| None`<br/><br/>**Default:** None |
