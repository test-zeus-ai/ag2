```python
Neo4jGraphQueryEngine(**kwargs)
```

    This class serves as a wrapper for a property graph query engine backed by LlamaIndex and Neo4j,
    facilitating the creating, connecting, updating, and querying of LlamaIndex property graphs.
    
    It builds a property graph Index from input documents,
    storing and retrieving data from the property graph in the Neo4j database.
    
    It extracts triplets, i.e., [entity] -> [relationship] -> [entity] sets,
    from the input documents using llamIndex extractors.
    
    Users can provide custom entities, relationships, and schema to guide the extraction process.
    
    If strict is True, the engine will extract triplets following the schema
    of allowed relationships for each entity specified in the schema.
    
    It also leverages LlamaIndex's chat engine which has a conversation history internally to provide context-aware responses.
    
    For usage, please refer to example notebook/agentchat_graph_rag_neo4j.ipynb
    
    Initialize a Neo4j Property graph.
