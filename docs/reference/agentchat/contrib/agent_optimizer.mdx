### execute\_func

```python
def execute_func(name, packages, code, **args)
```

The wrapper for generated functions.

## AgentOptimizer

```python
class AgentOptimizer()
```

Base class for optimizing AutoGen agents. Specifically, it is used to optimize the functions used in the agent.
More information could be found in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11359.

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(max_actions_per_step: int,
             llm_config: dict,
             optimizer_model: Optional[str] = "gpt-4-1106-preview")
```

(These APIs are experimental and may change in the future.)

**Arguments**:

- `max_actions_per_step` _int_ - the maximum number of actions that the optimizer can take in one step.
- `llm_config` _dict_ - llm inference configuration.
  Please refer to [OpenAIWrapper.create](/docs/reference/oai/client#create) for available options.
  When using OpenAI or Azure OpenAI endpoints, please specify a non-empty 'model' either in `llm_config` or in each config of 'config_list' in `llm_config`.
- `optimizer_model` - the model used for the optimizer.

### record\_one\_conversation

```python
def record_one_conversation(conversation_history: list[dict],
                            is_satisfied: bool = None)
```

Record one conversation history.

**Arguments**:

- `conversation_history` _List[Dict]_ - the chat messages of the conversation.
- `is_satisfied` _bool_ - whether the user is satisfied with the solution. If it is none, the user will be asked to input the satisfaction.

### step

```python
def step()
```

One step of training. It will return register_for_llm and register_for_executor at each iteration,
which are subsequently utilized to update the assistant and executor agents, respectively.
See example: https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_agentoptimizer.ipynb

### reset\_optimizer

```python
def reset_optimizer()
```

Reset the optimizer.
