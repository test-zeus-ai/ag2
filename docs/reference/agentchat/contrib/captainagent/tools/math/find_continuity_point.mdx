### find\_continuity\_point

```python
def find_continuity_point(f_leq, f_gt, x_value)
```

Find the value 'a' that ensures the continuity of a piecewise function at a given point.

**Arguments**:

- `f_leq` _str_ - The function expression for f(x) when x is less than or equal to the continuity point, in the form of a string.
- `f_gt` _str_ - The function expression for f(x) when x is greater than the continuity point, in the form of a string.
- `x_value` _float_ - The x-value at which continuity is to be ensured.
  

**Returns**:

  float or None: The value of 'a' that satisfies the continuity condition,
  or None if no such value exists.
