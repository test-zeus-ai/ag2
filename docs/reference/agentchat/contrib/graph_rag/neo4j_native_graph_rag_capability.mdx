## Neo4jNativeGraphCapability

```python
class Neo4jNativeGraphCapability(GraphRagCapability)
```

The Neo4j native graph capability integrates Neo4j native query engine into a graph rag agent.

For usage, please refer to example notebook/agentchat_graph_rag_neo4j_native.ipynb

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(query_engine: Neo4jNativeGraphQueryEngine)
```

Initialize GraphRAG capability with a neo4j native graph query engine

### add\_to\_agent

```python
def add_to_agent(agent: ConversableAgent)
```

Add native Neo4j GraphRAG capability to a ConversableAgent.
llm_config of the agent must be None/False (default) to make sure the returned message only contains information retrieved from the graph DB instead of any LLMs.
