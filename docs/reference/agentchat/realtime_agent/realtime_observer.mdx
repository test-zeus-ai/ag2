## RealtimeObserver

```python
class RealtimeObserver(ABC)
```

Observer for the OpenAI Realtime API.

```python
def __init__(*, logger: Optional[Logger] = None) -> None
```

Observer for the OpenAI Realtime API.

**Arguments**:

- `logger` _Logger_ - The logger for the observer.

### run

```python
async def run(agent: "RealtimeAgent") -> None
```

Run the observer with the agent.

When implementing, be sure to call `self._ready_event.set()` when the observer is ready to process events.

- `agent` _RealtimeAgent_ - The realtime agent attached to the observer.

### run\_loop

```python
@abstractmethod
async def run_loop() -> None
```

Run the loop if needed.

This method is called after the observer is ready to process events.
Events will be processed by the on_event method, this is just a hook for additional processing.
Use initialize_session to set up the session.

### initialize\_session

```python
@abstractmethod
async def initialize_session() -> None
```

Initialize the session for the observer.

### wait\_for\_ready

```python
async def wait_for_ready() -> None
```

Get the event that is set when the observer is ready.

### on\_event

```python
@abstractmethod
async def on_event(event: dict[str, Any]) -> None
```

Handle an event from the OpenAI Realtime API.

**Arguments**:

- `event` _RealtimeServerEvent_ - The event from the OpenAI Realtime API.
