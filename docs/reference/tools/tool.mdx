## Tool

```python
class Tool()
```

A class representing a Tool that can be used by an agent for various tasks.

This class encapsulates a tool with a name, description, and an executable function.
The tool can be registered with a ConversableAgent for use either with an LLM or for direct execution.

**Attributes**:

- `name` _str_ - The name of the tool.
- `description` _str_ - A brief description of the tool's purpose or function.
- `func` _Callable[..., Any]_ - The function to be executed when the tool is called.

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(*,
             name: Optional[str] = None,
             description: Optional[str] = None,
             func_or_tool: Union["Tool", Callable[..., Any]]) -> None
```

Create a new Tool object.

**Arguments**:

- `name` _str_ - The name of the tool.
- `description` _str_ - The description of the tool.
- `func_or_tool` _Union[Tool, Callable[..., Any]]_ - The function or Tool instance to create a Tool from.

### register\_for\_llm

```python
def register_for_llm(agent: "ConversableAgent") -> None
```

Registers the tool for use with a ConversableAgent's language model (LLM).

This method registers the tool so that it can be invoked by the agent during
interactions with the language model.

**Arguments**:

- `agent` _ConversableAgent_ - The agent to which the tool will be registered.

### register\_for\_execution

```python
def register_for_execution(agent: "ConversableAgent") -> None
```

Registers the tool for direct execution by a ConversableAgent.

This method registers the tool so that it can be executed by the agent,
typically outside of the context of an LLM interaction.

**Arguments**:

- `agent` _ConversableAgent_ - The agent to which the tool will be registered.

### \_\_call\_\_

```python
def __call__(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any
```

Execute the tool by calling its underlying function with the provided arguments.

**Arguments**:

- `*args` - Positional arguments to pass to the tool
- `**kwargs` - Keyword arguments to pass to the tool
  

**Returns**:

  The result of executing the tool's function.

### tool\_schema

```python
@property
def tool_schema() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Get the schema for the tool.

This is the preferred way of handling function calls with OpeaAI and compatible frameworks.

### function\_schema

```python
@property
def function_schema() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Get the schema for the function.

This is the old way of handling function calls with OpenAI and compatible frameworks.
It is provided for backward compatibility.

### realtime\_tool\_schema

```python
@property
def realtime_tool_schema() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Get the schema for the tool.

This is the preferred way of handling function calls with OpeaAI and compatible frameworks.
