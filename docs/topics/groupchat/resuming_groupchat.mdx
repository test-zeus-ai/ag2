In GroupChat, we can resume a previous group chat by passing the
messages from that conversation to the GroupChatManager’s `resume`
function (or `a_resume` for asynchronous workflows). This prepares the
GroupChat, GroupChatManager, and group chat’s agents for resuming. An
agent’s `initiate_chat` can then be called to resume the chat.

The `resume` function returns the last agent in the messages as well as
the last message itself. These can be used to run the `initiate_chat`.

To resume, the agents, GroupChat, and GroupChatManager objects must
exist and match the original group chat.

The messages passed into the `resume` function can be passed in as a
JSON string or a `List[Dict]` of messages, typically from the
ChatResult’s `chat_history` of the previous conversation or the
GroupChat’s `messages` property. Use the GroupChatManager’s
`messages_to_string` function to retrieve a JSON string that can be used
for resuming:

```text
# Save chat messages for resuming later on using the chat history
messages_json = mygroupchatmanager.messages_to_string(previous_chat_result.chat_history)

# Alternatively you can use the GroupChat's messages property
messages_json = mygroupchatmanager.messages_to_string(mygroupchatmanager.groupchat.messages)
```

An example of the JSON string:

```json
[{"content": "Find the latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.", "role": "user", "name": "Admin"}, {"content": "Plan:\n1. **Engineer**: Search for the latest paper on GPT-4 on arXiv.\n2. **Scientist**: Read the paper and summarize the key findings and potential applications of GPT-4.\n3. **Engineer**: Identify potential software applications where GPT-4 can be utilized based on the scientist's summary.\n4. **Scientist**: Provide insights on the feasibility and impact of implementing GPT-4 in the identified software applications.\n5. **Engineer**: Develop a prototype or proof of concept to demonstrate how GPT-4 can be integrated into the selected software application.\n6. **Scientist**: Evaluate the prototype, provide feedback, and suggest any improvements or modifications.\n7. **Engineer**: Make necessary revisions based on the scientist's feedback and finalize the integration of GPT-4 into the software application.\n8. **Admin**: Review the final software application with GPT-4 integration and approve for further development or implementation.\n\nFeedback from admin and critic is needed for further refinement of the plan.", "role": "user", "name": "Planner"}, {"content": "Agree", "role": "user", "name": "Admin"}, {"content": "Great! Let's proceed with the plan outlined earlier. I will start by searching for the latest paper on GPT-4 on arXiv. Once I find the paper, the scientist will summarize the key findings and potential applications of GPT-4. We will then proceed with the rest of the steps as outlined. I will keep you updated on our progress.", "role": "user", "name": "Planner"}]
```

When preparing for resuming, the messages will be validated against the
groupchat’s agents to make sure that the messages can be assigned to
them. Messages will be allocated to the agents and then the last speaker
and message will be returned for use in `initiate_chat`.

#### Continuing a terminated conversation

If the previous group chat terminated and the resuming group chat has
the same termination condition (such as if the message contains
“TERMINATE”) then the conversation will terminate when resuming as the
terminate check occurs with the message passed in to `initiate_chat`.

If the termination condition is based on a string within the message,
you can pass in that string in the `remove_termination_string` parameter
of the `resume` function and it will be removed. If the termination
condition is more complicated, you will need to adjust the messages
accordingly before calling `resume`.

The `resume` function will then check if the last message provided still
meets the termination condition and warns you, if so.

## Example of resuming a GroupChat

Start with the LLM config. This can differ from the original group chat.

```python
import os

import autogen

# Put your api key in the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview",
        "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    }
]

gpt4_config = {
    "cache_seed": 42,  # change the cache_seed for different trials
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
}
```

This time, we will remove the termination message, by using the
`remove_termination_string` parameter, and then resume.

```python
# Prepare the group chat for resuming WITH removal of TERMINATE message
last_agent, last_message = manager.resume(messages=previous_state, remove_termination_string="TERMINATE")
```

``` text
Prepared group chat with 4 messages, the last speaker is Digital_Marketer
```

```python
# Resume the chat using the last agent and message
result = last_agent.initiate_chat(recipient=manager, message=last_message, clear_history=False)
```

Digital_Marketer (to chat_manager):

Thank you, Chief_Marketing_Officer!  For 'EcoLux', I propose the following three marketing strategies:  1. 'Green Revolution' Campaign: Highlighting the eco-friendly features of EcoLux through a series of social media ads and influencer partnerships. We can partner with eco-conscious influencers to showcase how EcoLux is not only a luxury car but also an environmentally responsible choice. 2. 'Fuel for Thought' Content Series: Creating a content series that explores the intersection of technology, sustainability, and luxury. This could include blog posts, videos, and podcasts that delve into the innovative features of EcoLux and its impact on the environment. 3. 'EcoLux Experience' Event Marketing: Hosting exclusive events and test drives for potential customers to experience the performance and eco-friendliness of EcoLux firsthand. These events can be held at upscale locations and feature interactive exhibits, product demonstrations, and networking opportunities.  These strategies will help position EcoLux as a leader in the luxury electric-vehicle market while appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who value innovation and sustainability.

We can see that the conversation continued, the Chief_Marketing_officer
spoke and they terminated the conversation.

```python
# Output the final chat history showing the original 4 messages and the resumed message
for i, message in enumerate(groupchat.messages):
    print(
        f"#{i + 1}, {message['name']}: {message['content'][:80]}".replace("\n", " "),
        f"{'...' if len(message['content']) > 80 else ''}".replace("\n", " "),

## Example of resuming a terminated GroupChat with a new message and agent

Rather than continuing a group chat by using the last message, we can
resume a group chat using a new message.

**IMPORTANT**: To remain in a group chat, use the GroupChatManager to
initiate the chat, otherwise you can continue with an agent-to-agent
conversation by using another agent to initiate the chat.

We’ll continue with the previous example by using the messages from that
conversation and resuming it with a new conversation in the agent
‘meeting’.

We start by preparing the group chat by using the messages from the
previous chat.

```python
# Prepare the group chat for resuming using the previous messages. We don't need to remove the TERMINATE string as we aren't using the last message for resuming.
last_agent, last_message = manager.resume(messages=groupchat.messages)
```

``` text
WARNING: Last message meets termination criteria and this may terminate the chat. Set ignore_initial_termination_check=False to avoid checking termination at the start of the chat.
```

``` text
Prepared group chat with 5 messages, the last speaker is Chief_Marketing_Officer
```

Let’s continue the meeting with a new topic.

```python
# Resume the chat using a different agent and message
result = manager.initiate_chat(
    recipient=cmo,
    message="Team, let's now think of a name for the next vehicle that embodies that idea. Chief_Marketing_Officer and Product_manager can you both suggest one and then we can conclude.",
    clear_history=False,
)
```

``` text
chat_manager (to Chief_Marketing_Officer):

Team, let's now think of a name for the next vehicle that embodies that idea. Chief_Marketing_Officer and Product_manager can you both suggest one and then we can conclude.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chief_Marketing_Officer (to chat_manager):

Given the focus on sustainability and luxury, I suggest the name "VerdeVogue" for our next vehicle. "Verde" reflects the green, eco-friendly aspect of the car, while "Vogue" emphasizes its stylish and trendsetting nature in the luxury market. This name encapsulates the essence of combining environmental responsibility with high-end design and performance. 

Now, I'd like to hear the Product_Manager's suggestion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Product_Manager (to chat_manager):

For our next vehicle, I propose the name "EcoPrestige." This name highlights the vehicle's eco-friendly nature and its luxurious, prestigious status in the market. "Eco" emphasizes our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, while "Prestige" conveys the car's high-end quality, sophistication, and the elite status it offers to its owners. This name perfectly blends our goals of offering a sustainable luxury vehicle that doesn't compromise on performance or style.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chief_Marketing_Officer (to chat_manager):

Thank you, Product_Manager, for your suggestion. Both "VerdeVogue" and "EcoPrestige" capture the essence of our new vehicle's eco-friendly luxury. As we move forward, we'll consider these names carefully to ensure our branding aligns perfectly with our product's unique value proposition and market positioning. 

This concludes our meeting. Thank you, everyone, for your valuable contributions. TERMINATE.
