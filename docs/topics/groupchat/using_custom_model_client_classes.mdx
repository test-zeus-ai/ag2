<div class="tip">
<Tip>
This documentation only applies when using the 'auto' speaker selection method for GroupChat **and** your GroupChatManager is using a Custom Model Client class.

You don't need to change your GroupChat if either of these are the case:
- You are using a different speaker selection method, such as 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin', or a Callable
- Your GroupChatManager doesn't use a Custom Model Client class
</Tip>
</div>


During a group chat using the `auto` speaker selection method, an inner
conversation between two agents is created to determine the next speaker
after each turn. One of the speakers will take the `llm_config` from the
`GroupChatManager` (the other inner agent doesn’t use an `llm_config`).

If the configuration for the GroupChatManager is using a Custom Model
Client Class this is not propagated through to the inner conversation.

So, you can control the configuration that the inner conversation agent
uses by setting two properties on GroupChat:

-   **select_speaker_auto_llm_config**: Set this to your llm_config with
    the custom model client
-   **select_speaker_auto_model_client_cls**: Set this to the class of
    your custom model client

This control enables you to register the custom model client class for,
or assign a completely different `llm_config` to, the inner conversation
agent.

See a simple example below.

### Imports

```python
from autogen.agentchat import ConversableAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager
```

### Sample Custom Model Client class

The class below is an example of a custom model client class that always
returns the name `Alexandra`.

```python
import random
from types import SimpleNamespace


class MyCustomModelClient:
    def __init__(self, config, **kwargs):
        print(f"CustomModelClient config: {config}")

    def create(self, params):
        num_of_responses = params.get("n", 1)

        response = SimpleNamespace()
        response.choices = []
        response.model = "anything"

        # Randomly choose between Alexandra, Mark, and Elizabeth as next speaker
        agent_names = ["Alexandra", "Mark", "Elizabeth"]
        random_index = random.randint(0, 2)

        for _ in range(num_of_responses):
            text = f"Randomly choosing... {agent_names[random_index]}"
            choice = SimpleNamespace()
            choice.message = SimpleNamespace()
            choice.message.content = text
            choice.message.function_call = None
            response.choices.append(choice)
        return response

    def message_retrieval(self, response):
        choices = response.choices
        return [choice.message.content for choice in choices]

    def cost(self, response) -> float:
        response.cost = 0
        return 0

    @staticmethod
    def get_usage(response):
        return {}
```

### GroupChat with Custom Model Client class

Here we create `llm_config` that will use an actual LLM, then we create
`custom_llm_config` that uses the custom model client class that we
specified earlier.

We add a few agents, all using the LLM-based configuration.

```python
# Configuration for agents
llm_config = {
    "config_list": [
        {
            "api_type": "ollama",
            "model": "llama3.1:8b",
        }
    ]
}

# Configuration for GroupChatManager
# using a Custom Model Client class (above)
custom_llm_config = {
    "config_list": [
        {
            "model_client_cls": "MyCustomModelClient",
        }
    ]
}

mark = ConversableAgent(
    name="Mark",
    system_message="You are a customer who likes asking questions about accounting.",
    description="Customer who needs accounting help.",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

alexandra = ConversableAgent(
    name="Alexandra",
    system_message="You are an accountant who provides detailed responses about accounting.",
    description="Accountant who loves to talk about accounting!",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

elizabeth = ConversableAgent(
    name="Elizabeth",
    system_message="You are a head accountant who checks the answers of other accountants. Finish your response with the word 'BAZINGA'.",
    description="Head accountants, checks answers from accountants for validity.",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

Now, we assign the `custom_llm_config` (which uses the custom model
client class) and the custom model client class, `MyCustomModelClient`,
to the GroupChat so the inner conversation will use it.

```python
gc = GroupChat(
    agents=[mark, alexandra, elizabeth],
    speaker_selection_method="auto",
    allow_repeat_speaker=False,
    select_speaker_auto_verbose=True,
    select_speaker_auto_llm_config=custom_llm_config,
    select_speaker_auto_model_client_cls=MyCustomModelClient,
    max_round=5,
    messages=[],
)
```

With that setup, we create the GroupChatManager, which will use the
LLM-based config. So, the custom model client class will only be used
for the inner, select speaker, agent of the GroupChat.

```python
gcm = GroupChatManager(
    groupchat=gc,
    name="moderator",
    system_message="You are moderating a chat between a customer, an accountant, and a head accountant. The customer asks a question, the accountant answers it, and the head accountant then validates it.",
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "BAZINGA" in msg["content"].lower(),
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

result = gcm.initiate_chat(
    recipient=mark,
    message="Mark, ask us an accounting question. Alexandra and Elizabeth will help you out.",
    summary_method="last_msg",
)
```

I've been trying to understand how to properly capitalize versus expense certain costs in our company's general ledger. Let me give you some background.

We're a small manufacturing business that just purchased new equipment worth $100,000. The seller is financing 50% of the purchase price as a loan, with an interest rate of 6%. We'll be using this equipment for multiple years to produce goods.

Here's my question: should we capitalize the full $100,000 cost or only the portion that we paid out-of-pocket, which was $50,000?

A great question that gets to the heart of accounting principles!

In your case, you'll want to use the Full Amortization Method (also known as Straight-Line Depreciation) to depreciate the equipment over its useful life. This method assumes that the equipment will be used for a certain number of years, and you'll depreciate it evenly over that period.

According to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), you should capitalize the full purchase price of the equipment, which is $100,000. This includes both the cash outlay ($50,000) and the financing portion ($50,000).

Here's why:

1. **GAAP requires capitalization**: When an asset is purchased or constructed, it must be capitalized in its entirety, regardless of how it was financed.
2. **The equipment has a useful life**: Since you'll be using the equipment for multiple years to produce goods, it will have a useful life beyond the initial year. This means that the entire purchase price should be recognized as an asset on your balance sheet.
3. **Depreciation will be calculated based on the total cost**: You'll depreciate the equipment over its useful life, using the straight-line method. The depreciation expense will be calculated based on the total cost of the equipment, including both the cash outlay and the financed portion.

To illustrate this:

Assume the equipment has a useful life of 5 years.

* Total cost: $100,000
* Annual depreciation expense = ($100,000 ÷ 5) = $20,000 per year

In each of the 5 years, you'll record an annual depreciation expense of $20,000, which will be calculated based on the total cost of the equipment.

In summary, capitalize the full $100,000 purchase price of the equipment, and depreciate it over its useful life using the straight-line method. This ensures that your accounting records accurately reflect the economic reality of owning an asset with a finite useful life.

Wow, I'm glad you explained this in such detail! I have one more question to clarify: how will we account for the interest expense related to the financed portion of the equipment? Should we recognize it as a separate expense or is it already included in the depreciation calculation?

In other words, do we need to make an additional journal entry to record the interest expense, or is it implicit in the depreciation calculation I mentioned earlier?

A well-structured question that gets to the heart of accounting principles indeed!

To clarify, you should recognize both the capitalization of the full purchase price and the separate interest expense related to the financed portion.

The reason for this is that the financing cost (interest) is a distinct economic transaction from the acquisition of the asset. As such, it's necessary to account for it separately as an expense.

When you capitalize the equipment using the full Amortization Method, you're essentially recognizing the present value of the future benefits (or depreciation) associated with owning the asset. However, this method doesn't account for the financing cost explicitly.

To record the interest expense related to the financed portion, you'll need to make an additional journal entry. This can be done by debiting Interest Expense and crediting Interest Payable (if there's a short-term obligation to pay interest) or the long-term loan liability account (if it's a long-term financing arrangement).

To illustrate this:

Assume the same equipment with a $100,000 purchase price and a 6% interest rate on the financed portion ($50,000). The interest expense for each year would be calculated as follows:

Interest Expense = Financed Portion x Interest Rate
= $50,000 x 6%
= $3,000 per year

You'll record this interest expense separately from the depreciation calculation. For example, in Year 1, you might have a journal entry like this:

Debit: Interest Expense ($3,000)
Credit: Interest Payable (or Long-Term Loan Liability) ($3,000)

This way, you're accurately reflecting both the capitalization of the asset and the financing costs associated with its acquisition.

In summary, capitalize the full $100,000 purchase price using the straight-line method, and recognize a separate interest expense related to the financed portion. This will ensure that your accounting records accurately reflect the economic reality of owning an asset with a finite useful life and associated financing costs.

BAZINGA!

You're not only clever but also enthusiastic about accounting!

I'm glad I could help clarify the accounting treatment for capitalizing the equipment and recognizing the interest expense related to the financed portion. You've got it spot on: capitalize the full purchase price using the straight-line method, and record a separate interest expense related to the financed portion.

The key takeaway is that these are two distinct economic transactions that need to be accounted for separately:

1. **Capitalization of the asset**: Recognizing the present value of future benefits (or depreciation) associated with owning the asset.
2. **Interest expense on financing**: Accounting for the cost of borrowing funds to acquire the asset.

By making separate journal entries for these two items, you'll ensure that your accounting records accurately reflect the economic reality of your business.

Remember, accounting is all about providing a clear and accurate picture of a company's financial position and performance. It's not just about following rules and procedures; it's about telling the story of how a business operates and making informed decisions based on that story.

Keep asking questions, and I'll be here to help you navigate the world of accounting!

We can see that the inner `speaker_selection_agent` was returning random
names for the next agent, highlighting how we can control the
configuration that that inner agent used for `auto` speaker selection in
group chats.
