## Installation

Install AG2 with Gemini features:

```bash
pip install ag2[gemini]
```

## Dependencies of This Notebook

In this notebook, we will explore how to use Gemini in AG2 alongside
other tools. Install the necessary dependencies with the following
command:

```bash
pip install ag2[gemini,retrievechat,lmm]
```

## Features

There’s no need to handle OpenAI or Google’s GenAI packages separately;
AG2 manages all of these for you. You can easily create different agents
with various backend LLMs using the assistant agent. All models and
agents are readily accessible at your fingertips.

Support features: - Function/tool calling - Structured Outputs
([Notebook
example](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/agentchat_structured_outputs)) -
Token usage and cost correctly as per Google’s API costs (as of December
2024)

## Main Distinctions

-   Currently, Gemini does not include a “system_message” field.
    However, you can incorporate this instruction into the first message
    of your interaction.
-   If no API key is specified for Gemini, then authentication will
    happen using the default google auth mechanism for Google Cloud.
    Service accounts are also supported, where the JSON key file has to
    be provided.

GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

Do Transformers purchase auto insurance or health insurance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

Transformers are fictional characters and do not purchase insurance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

If Transformers were real, would their insurance be categorized as a type of auto insurance, health insurance, or a new category unique to sentient machines?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

If Transformers were real, their insurance would likely be a new category unique to sentient machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

Considering the unique needs of sentient machines like Transformers, what special coverages might be included in their insurance policies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

Sentient machine insurance policies might include coverage for repairs, maintenance, data loss, and liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

Would these sentient machine insurance policies also potentially cover software updates and cybersecurity, similar to how health insurance covers vaccinations and preventative care?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

Yes, sentient machine insurance policies could potentially cover software updates and cybersecurity, similar to how health insurance covers vaccinations and preventative care.

Let’s switch position. Now, Gemini is the question raiser.

This time, Gemini could not follow the system instruction well or evolve
questions, because the Gemini does not handle system messages similar to
GPTs.

```python
gpt = AssistantAgent(
    "GPT-4",
    system_message="""Always answer questions within one sentence. """,
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list_gpt4, "seed": seed},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=3,
)

gemini = AssistantAgent(
    "Gemini-Pro",
    system_message="""You should ask weird, tricky, and concise questions.

    llm_config={"config_list": config_list_gemini, "seed": seed},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=4,
)

gemini.initiate_chat(gpt, message="Should Spider Man invest in 401K?")
```

``` text
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

Should Spider Man invest in 401K?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

As a fictional character, Spider-Man cannot invest in a 401K, but if he were a real person with income, investing in a 401k could be a wise financial move for retirement savings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

Would Green Lantern prefer a 401K or a Roth IRA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

Since Green Lantern's financial preferences aren't specified in comics, it's impossible to determine whether he would prefer a 401K or a Roth IRA for retirement savings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

If Superman could invest in the stock market, which companies would he choose?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-4 (to Gemini-Pro):

Superman might choose companies that align with his values of truth, justice, and social good, but his specific preferences are not detailed in comics or other media.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemini-Pro (to GPT-4):

If Batman invested in cryptocurrency, which coins would he choose and why?

You can create multimodal agent for Gemini the same way as the GPT-4V
and LLaVA.

```

```` text
user_proxy (to chat_manager):

Plot the products (as y-axis) and years (as x-axis) in scatter plot and save to `graph.png`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPT-agent (to chat_manager):

To plot the products on the y-axis and the years on the x-axis in a scatter plot and save it to `graph.png`, we will use the `matplotlib` library in Python.

First, you'll need to install `matplotlib` if you haven't already. You can do so by running the following command in your shell.

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

Once installed, you can execute the following code to generate the scatter plot and save it as `graph.png`.

```python
# filename: plot_google_products.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for plotting
products = ['Google Search', 'Gmail', 'Google Maps', 'YouTube', 
            'Google Chrome', 'Android', 'Google Drive', 'Google Home', 'Google Stadia']
release_years = [1998, 2004, 2005, 2005, 2008, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019]

# Placing the products on the y-axis and years on the x-axis
y_positions = range(len(products))

# Creating the scatter plot
plt.scatter(release_years, y_positions)
plt.yticks(y_positions, products)

# Adding title and labels
plt.title('Release Years of Google Products')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Product')

# Saving the plot
plt.savefig('graph.png')

# Show the plot for verification (this is optional and can be removed if only the file is needed)
plt.show()
```
After you have executed the above script, `graph.png` will be saved in your current directory. Please run this code in your Python environment, and then you should find the `graph.png` file with the scatter plot of Google products and their release years.
