In the last two chapters we introduced the `ConversableAgent` class and
showed how you can use it to create autonomous
(`human_input_mode=NEVER`) agents that can accomplish tasks. We also
showed how to properly terminate a conversation between agents.

But many applications may require putting humans in-the-loop with
agents. For example, to allow human feedback to steer agents in the
right direction, specify goals, etc. In this chapter, we will show how
AutoGen supports human intervention.

In AutoGen’s `ConversableAgent`, the human-in-the-loop component sits in
front of the auto-reply components. It can intercept the incoming
messages and decide whether to pass them to the auto-reply components or
to provide human feedback. The figure below illustrates the design.

![Human in the loop](/docs/tutorial/assets/human-in-the-loop.png)

The human-in-the-loop component can be customized through the
`human_input_mode` parameter. We will show you how to use it in the
following sections.

## Human Input Modes

Currently AutoGen supports three modes for human input. The mode is
specified through the `human_input_mode` argument of the
`ConversableAgent`. The three modes are:

1.  `NEVER`: human input is never requested.
2.  `TERMINATE` (default): human input is only requested when a
    termination condition is met. Note that in this mode if the human
    chooses to intercept and reply, the conversation continues and the
    counter used by `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is reset.
3.  `ALWAYS`: human input is always requested and the human can choose
    to skip and trigger an auto-reply, intercept and provide feedback,
    or terminate the conversation. Note that in this mode termination
    based on `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is ignored.

The previous chapters already showed many examples of the cases when
`human_input_mode` is `NEVER`. Below we show one such example again and
then show the differences when this mode is set to `ALWAYS` and
`TERMINATE` instead.

## Human Input Mode = `NEVER` 

In this mode, human input is never requested and the termination
conditions are used to terminate. This mode is useful when you want your
agents to act fully autonomously.

Here is an example of using this mode to run a simple guess-a-number
game between two agents, the termination message is set to check for the
number that is the correct guess.

```python
import os

from autogen import ConversableAgent

agent_with_number = ConversableAgent(
    "agent_with_number",
    system_message="You are playing a game of guess-my-number. You have the "
    "number 53 in your mind, and I will try to guess it. "
    "If I guess too high, say 'too high', if I guess too low, say 'too low'. ",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]},
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "53" in msg["content"],  # terminate if the number is guessed by the other agent
    human_input_mode="NEVER",  # never ask for human input
)

agent_guess_number = ConversableAgent(
    "agent_guess_number",
    system_message="I have a number in my mind, and you will try to guess it. "
    "If I say 'too high', you should guess a lower number. If I say 'too low', "
    "you should guess a higher number. ",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]},
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

result = agent_with_number.initiate_chat(
    agent_guess_number,
    message="I have a number between 1 and 100. Guess it!",
)
```

``` text
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

I have a number between 1 and 100. Guess it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 50?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too low.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 75?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 63?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 57?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 54?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 52?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too low.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 53?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Yay! The game is over. The guessing agent got the number correctly using
binary search – very efficient! You can see that the conversation was
terminated after the guessing agent said the correct number, which
triggered the message-based termination condition.

## Human Input Mode = `ALWAYS` 

In this mode, human input is always requested and the human can choose
to skip, intercept , or terminate the conversation. Let us see this mode
in action by playing the same game as before with the agent with the
number, but this time participating in the game as a human. We will be
the agent that is guessing the number, and play against the agent with
the number from before.

```python
human_proxy = ConversableAgent(
    "human_proxy",
    llm_config=False,  # no LLM used for human proxy
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",  # always ask for human input
)

# Start a chat with the agent with number with an initial guess.
result = human_proxy.initiate_chat(
    agent_with_number,  # this is the same agent with the number as before
    message="10",
)
```

``` text
human_proxy (to agent_with_number):

10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to human_proxy):

Too low.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
human_proxy (to agent_with_number):

79

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to human_proxy):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
human_proxy (to agent_with_number):

76

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to human_proxy):

Too high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
human_proxy (to agent_with_number):

I give up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to human_proxy):

That's okay! The number I was thinking of was 53.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If you run the code above, you will be prompt to enter a response each
time it is your turn to speak. You can see the human in the conversation
was not very good at guessing the number… but hey the agent was nice
enough to give out the number in the end.

## Human Input Mode = `TERMINATE` 

In this mode, human input is only requested when a termination condition
is met. **If the human chooses to intercept and reply, the counter will
be reset**; if the human chooses to skip, the automatic reply mechanism
will be used; if the human chooses to terminate, the conversation will
be terminated.

Let us see this mode in action by playing the same game again, but this
time the guessing agent will only have two chances to guess the number,
and if it fails, the human will be asked to provide feedback, and the
guessing agent gets two more chances. If the correct number is guessed
eventually, the conversation will be terminated.

```python
agent_with_number = ConversableAgent(
    "agent_with_number",
    system_message="You are playing a game of guess-my-number. "
    "In the first game, you have the "
    "number 53 in your mind, and I will try to guess it. "
    "If I guess too high, say 'too high', if I guess too low, say 'too low'. ",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=1,  # maximum number of consecutive auto-replies before asking for human input
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "53" in msg["content"],  # terminate if the number is guessed by the other agent
    human_input_mode="TERMINATE",  # ask for human input until the game is terminated
)

agent_guess_number = ConversableAgent(
    "agent_guess_number",
    system_message="I have a number in my mind, and you will try to guess it. "
    "If I say 'too high', you should guess a lower number. If I say 'too low', "
    "you should guess a higher number. ",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]},
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

result = agent_with_number.initiate_chat(
    agent_guess_number,
    message="I have a number between 1 and 100. Guess it!",
)
```

``` text
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

I have a number between 1 and 100. Guess it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 50?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 52?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Too low.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 54?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_with_number (to agent_guess_number):

Almost there! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent_guess_number (to agent_with_number):

Is it 53?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

In the previous conversation,

1.  When the agent guessed “74”, the human said “It is too high my
    friend.”
2.  When the agent guessed “55”, the human said “still too high, but you
    are very close.”
3.  When the agent guessed “54”, the human said “Almost there!”

Each time after one auto-reply from the agent with the number, the human
was asked to provide feedback. Once the human provided feedback, the
counter was reset. The conversation was terminated after the agent
correctly guessed “53”.

## Summary

In this chapter, we showed you how to use the human-in-the-loop
component to provide human feedback to agent and to terminate
conversation. We also showed you the different human input modes and how
they affect the behavior of the human-in-the-loop component.

The next chapter will be all about code executor – the most powerful
component second only to LLMs.
