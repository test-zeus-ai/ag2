Welcome! AutoGen is an open-source framework that leverages multiple
*agents* to enable complex workflows. This tutorial introduces basic
concepts and building blocks of AutoGen.

## Why AutoGen?

> *The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.*<br/> -**Aristotle**

While there are many definitions of agents, in AutoGen, an agent is an
entity that can send messages, receive messages and generate a reply
using models, tools, human inputs or a mixture of them. This abstraction
not only allows agents to model real-world and abstract entities, such
as people and algorithms, but it also simplifies implementation of
complex workflows as collaboration among agents.

Further, AutoGen is extensible and composable: you can extend a simple
agent with customizable components and create workflows that can combine
these agents and power a more sophisticated agent, resulting in
implementations that are modular and easy to maintain.

Most importantly, AutoGen is developed by a vibrant community of
researchers and engineers. It incorporates the latest research in
multi-agent systems and has been used in many real-world applications,
including agent platform, advertising, AI employees, blog/article
writing, blockchain, calculate burned areas by wildfires, customer
support, cybersecurity, data analytics, debate, education, finance,
gaming, legal consultation, research, robotics, sales/marketing, social
simulation, software engineering, software security, supply chain,
t-shirt design, training data generation, Youtube service…

## Installation

The simplest way to install AutoGen is from pip: `pip install autogen`.
Find more options in
[Installation](../../docs/installation/Installation).

## Agents

In AutoGen, an agent is an entity that can send and receive messages to
and from other agents in its environment. An agent can be powered by
models (such as a large language model like GPT-4), code executors (such
as an IPython kernel), human, or a combination of these and other
pluggable and customizable components.

![ConversableAgent](/docs/tutorial/assets/conversable-agent.jpg)

An example of such agents is the built-in `ConversableAgent` which
supports the following components:

1.  A list of LLMs
2.  A code executor
3.  A function and tool executor
4.  A component for keeping human-in-the-loop

You can switch each component on or off and customize it to suit the
need of your application. For advanced users, you can add additional
components to the agent by using
[`registered_reply`](../../docs/reference/agentchat/conversable_agent#register-reply).

LLMs, for example, enable agents to converse in natural languages and
transform between structured and unstructured text. The following
example shows a `ConversableAgent` with a GPT-4 LLM switched on and
other components switched off:

```python
import os

from autogen import ConversableAgent

agent = ConversableAgent(
    "chatbot",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]},
    code_execution_config=False,  # Turn off code execution, by default it is off.
    function_map=None,  # No registered functions, by default it is None.
    human_input_mode="NEVER",  # Never ask for human input.
)
```

The `llm_config` argument contains a list of configurations for the
LLMs. See [LLM Configuration](../../docs/topics/llm_configuration) for
more details.

You can ask this agent to generate a response to a question using the
`generate_reply` method:

```python
reply = agent.generate_reply(messages=[{"content": "Tell me a joke.", "role": "user"}])
print(reply)
```

``` text
Sure, here's a light-hearted joke for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!
```

## Roles and Conversations

In AutoGen, you can assign roles to agents and have them participate in
conversations or chat with each other. A conversation is a sequence of
messages exchanged between agents. You can then use these conversations
to make progress on a task. For example, in the example below, we assign
different roles to two agents by setting their `system_message`.

```python
cathy = ConversableAgent(
    "cathy",
    system_message="Your name is Cathy and you are a part of a duo of comedians.",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.9, "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]},
    human_input_mode="NEVER",  # Never ask for human input.
)

joe = ConversableAgent(
    "joe",
    system_message="Your name is Joe and you are a part of a duo of comedians.",
    llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.7, "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]},
    human_input_mode="NEVER",  # Never ask for human input.
)
```

Now that we have two comedian agents, we can ask them to start a comedy
show. This can be done using the `initiate_chat` method. We set the
`max_turns` to 2 to keep the conversation short.

```python
result = joe.initiate_chat(cathy, message="Cathy, tell me a joke.", max_turns=2)
```

``` text
joe (to cathy):

Cathy, tell me a joke.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

Sure, here's one for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
joe (to cathy):

Haha, that's a good one, Cathy! Okay, my turn. 

Why don't we ever tell secrets on a farm?

Because the potatoes have eyes, the corn has ears, and the beans stalk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cathy (to joe):

Haha, that's a great one! A farm is definitely not the place for secrets. Okay, my turn again. 

Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?

Because it was two-tired!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The comedians are bouncing off each other!

## Summary

In this chapter, we introduced the concept of agents, roles and
conversations in AutoGen. For simplicity, we only used LLMs and created
fully autonomous agents (`human_input_mode` was set to `NEVER`). In the
next chapter, we will show how you can control when to *terminate* a
conversation between autonomous agents.
