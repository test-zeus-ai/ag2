Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/) Reference: [Agent
AutoBuild](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2023-11-26-Agent-AutoBuild/index)

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which
can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This
framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we introduce a new class, `AgentBuilder`, to help user
build an automatic task solving process powered by multi-agent system.
Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple
participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this
task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source
LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and
[Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported
model list
[here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).

## Requirement

AutoBuild require `autogen[autobuild]`, which can be installed by the
following command:

```python
%pip install autogen[autobuild]
```

## Step 1: prepare configuration and some useful functions

Prepare a `config_file_or_env` for assistant agent to limit the choice
of LLM you want to use in this task. This config can be a path of json
file or a name of environment variable. A `default_llm_config` is also
required for initialize the specific config of LLMs like seed,
temperature, etcâ€¦

```python
import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder

config_file_or_env = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"
llm_config = {"temperature": 0}
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_file_or_env, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-turbo", "gpt-4"]})


def start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list, coding=True):
    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(
        agents=agent_list,
        messages=[],
        max_round=12,
        allow_repeat_speaker=agent_list[:-1] if coding is True else agent_list,
    )
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(
        groupchat=group_chat,
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list, **llm_config},
    )
    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)
```

## Step 2: create a AgentBuilder

Create a `AgentBuilder` with the specified `config_path_or_env`.
AgentBuilder will use `gpt-4` in default to complete the whole process,
you can specify the `builder_model` and `agent_model` to other OpenAI
model to match your task. You can also specify an open-source LLM
supporting by vLLM and FastChat, see blog for more details.

```python
builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model=["gpt-4-turbo"], agent_model=["gpt-4-turbo"]
)
```

## Step 3: specify a building task

Specify a building task with a general description. Building task will
help build manager (a LLM) decide what agents should be built.

```python
building_task = "Generate some agents that can find papers on arxiv by programming and analyzing them in specific domains related to computer science and medical science."
```

## Step 4: build group chat agents

Use `build()` to let build manager (the specified `builder_model`)
complete the group chat agents generation. If you think coding is
necessary in your task, you can use `coding=True` to add a user proxy
(an automatic code interpreter) into the agent list, like:

```python
builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, coding=True)
```

If `coding` is not specified, AgentBuilder will determine on its own
whether the user proxy should be added or not according to the task.

```python
agent_list, agent_configs = builder.build(building_task, llm_config)
```

``` text

## Step 5: execute task

Let agents generated in `build()` to complete the task collaboratively
in a group chat.

```python
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
    coding=agent_configs["coding"],
)
```

AI_ComputerScience_Expert (to chat_manager):

To find a recent paper about GPT-4 on arXiv and explore its potential applications in software, we can utilize the arXiv API to search for papers related to "GPT-4". I can write a Python script to fetch this information. Let's proceed with that.

```python
import requests
from xml.etree import ElementTree

def search_arxiv(query, max_results=10):
    url = 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:' + query + '&start=0&max_results=' + str(max_results)
    response = requests.get(url)
    root = ElementTree.fromstring(response.content)
    papers = []
    for entry in root.findall('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}entry'):
        title = entry.find('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}title').text
        summary = entry.find('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}summary').text
        papers.append({'title': title, 'summary': summary})
    return papers

# Search for GPT-4 related papers
papers = search_arxiv('GPT-4')
for paper in papers:
    print(f"Title: {paper['title']}\nSummary: {paper['summary']}\n")
```

This script will fetch the titles and summaries of papers related to GPT-4 from arXiv. We can then analyze these summaries to identify potential applications in software. Shall I proceed to execute this script?

Title: Can LLMs like GPT-4 outperform traditional AI tools in dementia
  diagnosis? Maybe, but not today
Summary:   Recent investigations show that large language models (LLMs), specifically
GPT-4, not only have remarkable capabilities in common Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks but also exhibit human-level performance on various
professional and academic benchmarks. However, whether GPT-4 can be directly
used in practical applications and replace traditional artificial intelligence
(AI) tools in specialized domains requires further experimental validation. In
this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs such as GPT-4 to outperform
traditional AI tools in dementia diagnosis. Comprehensive comparisons between
GPT-4 and traditional AI tools are conducted to examine their diagnostic
accuracy in a clinical setting. Experimental results on two real clinical
datasets show that, although LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrate potential for future
advancements in dementia diagnosis, they currently do not surpass the
performance of traditional AI tools. The interpretability and faithfulness of
GPT-4 are also evaluated by comparison with real doctors. We discuss the
limitations of GPT-4 in its current state and propose future research
directions to enhance GPT-4 in dementia diagnosis.


Title: GPT-4 Can't Reason
Summary:   GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial
improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model,
which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However, despite the
genuinely impressive improvement, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical
of GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of
reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP
community, as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently
evaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and
performs a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4's performance on those
problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that, despite its
occasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly
incapable of reasoning.


Title: Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Ability of ChatGPT and GPT-4
Summary:   Harnessing logical reasoning ability is a comprehensive natural language
understanding endeavor. With the release of Generative Pretrained Transformer 4
(GPT-4), highlighted as "advanced" at reasoning tasks, we are eager to learn
the GPT-4 performance on various logical reasoning tasks. This report analyses
multiple logical reasoning datasets, with popular benchmarks like LogiQA and
ReClor, and newly-released datasets like AR-LSAT. We test the multi-choice
reading comprehension and natural language inference tasks with benchmarks
requiring logical reasoning. We further construct a logical reasoning
out-of-distribution dataset to investigate the robustness of ChatGPT and GPT-4.
We also make a performance comparison between ChatGPT and GPT-4. Experiment
results show that ChatGPT performs significantly better than the RoBERTa
fine-tuning method on most logical reasoning benchmarks. With early access to
the GPT-4 API we are able to conduct intense experiments on the GPT-4 model.
The results show GPT-4 yields even higher performance on most logical reasoning
datasets. Among benchmarks, ChatGPT and GPT-4 do relatively well on well-known
datasets like LogiQA and ReClor. However, the performance drops significantly
when handling newly released and out-of-distribution datasets. Logical
reasoning remains challenging for ChatGPT and GPT-4, especially on
out-of-distribution and natural language inference datasets. We release the
prompt-style logical reasoning datasets as a benchmark suite and name it
LogiEval.


Title: How is ChatGPT's behavior changing over time?
Summary:   GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM)
services. However, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque.
Here, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on
several diverse tasks: 1) math problems, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions, 3)
opinion surveys, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions, 5) generating
code, 6) US Medical License tests, and 7) visual reasoning. We find that the
performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.
For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs.
composite numbers (84% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same
questions (51% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenity
to follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better in
June than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive
questions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed
better at multi-hop questions in June than in March, while GPT-3.5's
performance dropped on this task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting
mistakes in code generation in June than in March. We provide evidence that
GPT-4's ability to follow user instructions has decreased over time, which is
one common factor behind the many behavior drifts. Overall, our findings show
that the behavior of the "same" LLM service can change substantially in a
relatively short amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous
monitoring of LLMs.


Title: Gpt-4: A Review on Advancements and Opportunities in Natural Language
  Processing
Summary:   Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is the fourth-generation
language model in the GPT series, developed by OpenAI, which promises
significant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In
this research article, we have discussed the features of GPT-4, its potential
applications, and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared
GPT-4 with its predecessor, GPT-3. GPT-4 has a larger model size (more than one
trillion), better multilingual capabilities, improved contextual understanding,
and reasoning capabilities than GPT-3. Some of the potential applications of
GPT-4 include chatbots, personal assistants, language translation, text
summarization, and question-answering. However, GPT-4 poses several challenges
and limitations such as computational requirements, data requirements, and
ethical concerns.


Title: Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?
Summary:   As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their powerful capabilities
in plenty of domains and tasks, including context understanding, code
generation, language generation, data storytelling, etc., many data analysts
may raise concerns if their jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence
(AI). This controversial topic has drawn great attention in public. However, we
are still at a stage of divergent opinions without any definitive conclusion.
Motivated by this, we raise the research question of "is GPT-4 a good data
analyst?" in this work and aim to answer it by conducting head-to-head
comparative studies. In detail, we regard GPT-4 as a data analyst to perform
end-to-end data analysis with databases from a wide range of domains. We
propose a framework to tackle the problems by carefully designing the prompts
for GPT-4 to conduct experiments. We also design several task-specific
evaluation metrics to systematically compare the performance between several
professional human data analysts and GPT-4. Experimental results show that
GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to humans. We also provide in-depth
discussions about our results to shed light on further studies before reaching
the conclusion that GPT-4 can replace data analysts.


Title: Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4
Summary:   Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in
automatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires
intensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and
search strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new
GPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The
basic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide
GPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts
consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search
feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS
generates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence.
Experimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the
state-of-the-art GNAS methods.


Title: Solving Challenging Math Word Problems Using GPT-4 Code Interpreter with
  Code-based Self-Verification
Summary:   Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and PaLM-2 has
brought significant advancements in addressing math reasoning problems. In
particular, OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4, known as GPT-4 Code Interpreter,
shows remarkable performance on challenging math datasets. In this paper, we
explore the effect of code on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability by
introducing different constraints on the \textit{Code Usage Frequency} of GPT-4
Code Interpreter. We found that its success can be largely attributed to its
powerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code
execution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs.
Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective prompting method,
explicit \uline{c}ode-based \uline{s}elf-\uline{v}erification~(CSV), to further
boost the mathematical reasoning potential of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This
method employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to
use code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state
registers as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution,
analogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics
examination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification
result indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the
effectiveness of majority voting. With GPT-4 Code Interpreter and CSV, we
achieve an impressive zero-shot accuracy on MATH dataset \textbf{(53.9\% $\to$
84.3\%)}.


Title: OpenAI Cribbed Our Tax Example, But Can GPT-4 Really Do Tax?
Summary:   The authors explain where OpenAI got the tax law example in its livestream
demonstration of GPT-4, why GPT-4 got the wrong answer, and how it fails to
reliably calculate taxes.


Title: GPT-4 Understands Discourse at Least as Well as Humans Do
Summary:   We test whether a leading AI system GPT-4 understands discourse as well as
humans do, using a standardized test of discourse comprehension. Participants
are presented with brief stories and then answer eight yes/no questions probing
their comprehension of the story. The questions are formatted to assess the
separate impacts of directness (stated vs. implied) and salience (main idea vs.
details). GPT-4 performs slightly, but not statistically significantly, better
than humans given the very high level of human performance. Both GPT-4 and
humans exhibit a strong ability to make inferences about information that is
not explicitly stated in a story, a critical test of understanding.

To assist with the request on finding a recent paper about LLaVA on arXiv and exploring its potential applications in computer vision, I will perform a search on arXiv for the most recent papers related to LLaVA and analyze any mentioned applications in the field of computer vision.

Let's start by searching for the most recent papers on this topic. I will write a Python script to query the arXiv API for papers related to "LLaVA" and "computer vision". Let's proceed with that.

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import feedparser

# Define the base URL for the arXiv API
base_url = 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?'

# Define the search parameters
search_query = 'all:LLaVA AND all:"computer vision"'  # Search for LLaVA and computer vision
start = 0  # Start at the first result
max_results = 5  # Get the top 5 results

query = f'search_query={urllib.parse.quote(search_query)}&start={start}&max_results={max_results}'
url = base_url + query

# Perform the HTTP request
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)

# Parse the response using feedparser
feed = feedparser.parse(response)

# Print out the entries (titles and links) for each returned article
for entry in feed.entries:
    print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in entry.authors)}")
    print(f"Published: {entry.published}")
    print(f"Link: {entry.link}")
    print(f"Summary: {entry.summary[:150]}...")  # Print the first 150 characters of the summary
    print("\n")
```

This script will retrieve the top 5 most relevant papers from arXiv that mention both LLaVA and computer vision. We can analyze these papers to identify potential applications in computer vision.
