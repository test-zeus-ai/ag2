In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from various
frameworks—including [LangChain
Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools), [CrewAI
Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main), and
[PydanticAI Tools](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/) into the AG2
framework. This process enables smooth interoperability between these
systems, allowing developers to leverage the unique capabilities of each
toolset within AG2’s flexible agent-based architecture. By the end of
this guide, you will understand how to configure agents, adapt these
tools for use in AG2, and validate the integration through practical
examples.

## LangChain Tools Integration

LangChain is a popular framework that offers a wide range of tools to
work with LLMs. LangChain has already implemented a variety of tools
that can be easily integrated into AG2. You can explore the available
tools in the [LangChain Community
Tools](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/community/langchain_community/tools)
folder. These tools, such as those for querying APIs, web scraping, and
text generation, can be quickly incorporated into AG2, providing
powerful functionality for your agents.

### Installation

To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the
required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-langchain]
```

Additionally, this notebook uses LangChain’s [Wikipedia
Tool](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_community.tools.wikipedia.tool.WikipediaQueryRun.html),
which requires the `wikipedia` package. Install it with:

```bash
pip install wikipedia
```

### Imports

Import necessary modules and tools.

-   [WikipediaQueryRun](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_community.tools.wikipedia.tool.WikipediaQueryRun.html)
    and
    [WikipediaAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.wikipedia.WikipediaAPIWrapper.html):
    Tools for querying Wikipedia.
-   `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`: Agents that facilitate
    communication in the AG2 framework.
-   `Interoperability`: This module acts as a bridge, making it easier
    to integrate LangChain tools with AG2’s architecture.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

The history of the United States began with the arrival of the first people in the Americas around 15,000 BC. European colonization commenced in the late 15th century, and this led to significant impacts on Indigenous societies, including wars and epidemics that decimated populations. By the 1760s, thirteen British colonies were firmly established. In the Southern Colonies, an agricultural economy heavily reliant on slave labor developed, involving the enslavement of millions of Africans.

Tensions arose in the 18th century between these colonies and Britain, primarily due to taxation without representation, which culminated in events such as the Boston Tea Party in 1773. These events prompted the British Parliament to pass the Intolerable Acts in an attempt to suppress self-governance in the colonies.

In 1776, the colonies declared their independence, forming the United States of America. Under the leadership of General George Washington, the colonies won the Revolutionary War against Britain, achieving victory in 1783. The United States adopted its Constitution in 1789, followed by the Bill of Rights in 1791, which enshrined fundamental rights.

George Washington became the first President, and along with his adviser Alexander Hamilton, began shaping the new nation's governmental and economic structures. This marked the early stages of the United States' journey to becoming an independent and unified country. TERMINATE

## PydanticAI Tools Integration

[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a newer framework that offers
powerful capabilities for working with LLMs. Although it currently does
not have a repository with pre-built tools, it provides features like
**dependency injection**, allowing you to inject a “Context” into a tool
for better execution without relying on LLMs. This context can be used
for passing parameters or managing state during the execution of a tool.
While the framework is still growing, you can integrate its tools into
AG2 to enhance agent capabilities, especially for tasks that involve
structured data and context-driven logic.

### Installation

To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the
required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-pydantic-ai]
```

### Imports

Import necessary modules and tools.

-   [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/): Used
    to define data structures for tool inputs and outputs.
-   [RunContext](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext):
    Provides context during the execution of tools.
-   [PydanticAITool](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.Tool):
    Represents a tool in the PydanticAI framework.
-   `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`: Agents that facilitate
    communication in the AG2 framework.
-   `Interoperability`: This module acts as a bridge, making it easier
    to integrate PydanticAI tools with AG2’s architecture.

```python
import os
from typing import Optional

from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import Tool as PydanticAITool

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

-   `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model
    and API key.
-   `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual
    human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
-   `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM
    settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    name="chatbot",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
```

### Tool Integration

Integrate the PydanticAI tool with AG2.

-   Define a `Player` model using
    [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) to
    structure the input data.
-   Use
    [RunContext](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext)
    to securely inject dependencies (like the `Player` instance) into
    the tool function without exposing them to the LLM.
-   Implement `get_player` to define the tool’s functionality, accessing
    `ctx.deps` for injected data.
-   Convert the tool to an AG2-compatible format with `Interoperability`
    and register it for execution and LLM communication.
-   Convert the PydanticAI tool into an AG2-compatible format using
    `convert_tool`.
-   Register the tool for both execution and communication with the LLM
    by associating it with the `user_proxy` and `chatbot`.

```python
class Player(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


def get_player(ctx: RunContext[Player], additional_info: Optional[str] = None) -> str:  # type: ignore[valid-type]
    """Get the player's name.

    Args:
        additional_info: Additional information which can be used.
    """
    return f"Name: {ctx.deps.name}, Age: {ctx.deps.age}, Additional info: {additional_info}"  # type: ignore[attr-defined]


interop = Interoperability()
pydantic_ai_tool = PydanticAITool(get_player, takes_ctx=True)

# player will be injected as a dependency
player = Player(name="Luka", age=25)
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=pydantic_ai_tool, type="pydanticai", deps=player)

ag2_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
ag2_tool.register_for_llm(chatbot)
```

Initiate a conversation between the `UserProxyAgent` and the
`AssistantAgent`.

-   Use the `initiate_chat` method to send a message from the
    `user_proxy` to the `chatbot`.
-   In this example, the user requests the chatbot to retrieve player
    information, providing “goal keeper” as additional context.
-   The `Player` instance is securely injected into the tool using
    [RunContext](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext),
    ensuring the chatbot can retrieve and use this data during the
    interaction.

```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=chatbot, message="Get player, for additional information use 'goal keeper'", max_turns=3
)
```
