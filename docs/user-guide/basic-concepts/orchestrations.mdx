title: Orchestrating many agents
---

Many hands make for light work, so it's time to move on from our simple two-agent conversations and think about orchestrating workflows containing many agents, a strength of the AG2 framework.

There are two mechanisms for building multi-agent workflows, <b>GroupChat</b> and <b>Swarm</b>.

1. GroupChat contains a number of built-in conversation patterns to determine the next agent. You can also define your own.

2. Swarm is a conversation pattern based on agents with handoffs. There's a shared context and each agent has tools and the ability to transfer control to other agents. The [original swarm concept](https://github.com/openai/swarm) was created by OpenAI.

Continue on to explore these.

<Note>
We'll refer to *[conversation patterns](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/conversation-patterns-deep-dive)* throughout the documentation - they are simply a structured way of organizing the flow between agents.
