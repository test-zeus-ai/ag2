AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which
can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This
framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

MathChat is an experimental conversational framework for math problem
solving. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use MathChat to solve
math problems. MathChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and
`MathUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent`
and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving
with Code Generation, Execution &
Debugging](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)).
Essentially, `MathUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply
mechanism corresponding to the MathChat prompts. You can find more
details in the paper [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem
Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337) or the
[blogpost](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2023-06-28-MathChat).


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
Some extra dependencies are needed for this notebook, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogen[mathchat]
```

For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/installation/Installation).
</Info>
</div>


## Set your API Endpoint

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
import os

import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.math_user_proxy_agent import MathUserProxyAgent

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": {
            "gpt-4-1106-preview",
            "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "gpt-35-turbo",
        }
    },
)
```

It first looks for environment variable “OAI_CONFIG_LIST” which needs to
be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for
a json file named “OAI_CONFIG_LIST”. It filters the configs by models
(you can filter by other keys as well).

The config list looks like the following:

```python
config_list = [
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2024-02-01',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2024-02-01',
    },
]
```

If you open this notebook in colab, you can upload your files by
clicking the file icon on the left panel and then choose “upload file”
icon.

You can set the value of config_list in other ways you prefer, e.g.,
loading from a YAML file.

## Construct agents for MathChat

We start by initializing the `AssistantAgent` and `MathUserProxyAgent`.
The system message needs to be set to “You are a helpful assistant.” for
MathChat. The detailed instructions are given in the user message. Later
we will use the `MathUserProxyAgent.message_generator` to combine the
instructions and a math problem for an initial message to be sent to the
LLM assistant.

```python
# 1. create an AssistantAgent instance named "assistant"
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant.",
    llm_config={
        "timeout": 600,
        "seed": 42,
        "config_list": config_list,
    },
)

# 2. create the MathUserProxyAgent instance named "mathproxyagent"
# By default, the human_input_mode is "NEVER", which means the agent will not ask for human input.
mathproxyagent = MathUserProxyAgent(
    name="mathproxyagent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
)
```

### Example 1

Problem: Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality
$(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Solution: We have This inequality is satisfied if and only if
$(x+14)$ and $(x+3)$ are either both positive or both negative. Both
factors are positive for $x>-3$ and both factors are negative for
$x<-14$. When $-14<x<-3$, one factor is positive and the other negative,
so their product is negative. Therefore, the range of $x$ that satisfies
the inequality is \$ \$.

```python
# given a math problem, we use the mathproxyagent to generate a prompt to be sent to the assistant as the initial message.
# the assistant receives the message and generates a response. The response will be sent back to the mathproxyagent for processing.
# The conversation continues until the termination condition is met, in MathChat, the termination condition is the detect of "\boxed{}" in the response.
math_problem = (
    "Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation."
)

# We call `initiate_chat` to start the conversation.
# When setting `message=mathproxyagent.message_generator`, you need to pass in the problem through the `problem` parameter.
mathproxyagent.initiate_chat(assistant, message=mathproxyagent.message_generator, problem=math_problem)
```

mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

Key idea: To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we will expand both sides, simplify the resulting expression, and then solve for $x$. This process may involve factoring a quadratic expression and finding the critical points where the inequality may change signs. We will analyze the intervals between these points to determine where the inequality holds true.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Expand both sides of the inequality.

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand

x = symbols('x')
lhs = expand((2*x + 10) * (x + 3))
rhs = expand((3*x + 9) * (x + 8))
```

Step 2: Subtract one side of the inequality from the other to move all terms to one side.

```python
inequality = lhs - rhs
```

Step 3: Factor the resulting expression to find the critical points (where the expression is equal to zero).

```python
from sympy import solve

critical_points = solve(inequality, x)
```

Step 4: Determine intervals based on the critical points and test the intervals to find where the inequality holds true.

```python
from sympy import solveset, S

# finding the intervals where the inequality holds true
solution_intervals = solveset(inequality, x, domain=S.Reals)
```

Step 5: Output the solution in interval notation.

```python
print(solution_intervals)
```

This will give us the solution in interval notation. Now, let's run this code step by step. Please run Step 1 to calculate the expanded forms of both sides of the inequality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

No output found. Make sure you print the results.

  File "", line 16, in <module>
    print(solution_intervals)
NameError: name 'solution_intervals' is not defined

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's correct the code by first expanding and printing out the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality. Afterward, we will proceed to the next steps sequentially. Here is the corrected code for Step 1:

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand

x = symbols('x')
lhs = expand((2*x + 10) * (x + 3))
rhs = expand((3*x + 9) * (x + 8))
# Print the expanded left-hand side and right-hand side
print("Expanded LHS:", lhs)
print("Expanded RHS:", rhs)
```

Run this code to get the expanded forms. After we confirm the expanded results are correct, we will move on to Step 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Expanded LHS: 2*x**2 + 16*x + 30
Expanded RHS: 3*x**2 + 33*x + 72

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The expanded forms of the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the inequality are correct:

LHS: $2x^2 + 16x + 30$

RHS: $3x^2 + 33x + 72$

Now, let's proceed to Step 2, where we will calculate the expression resulting from subtracting the RHS from the LHS, and then move on to factoring that expression.

```python
from sympy import simplify

# Compute the difference between RHS and LHS
inequality_expression = simplify(lhs - rhs)

# Print the simplified inequality expression
print("Inequality expression (LHS - RHS):", inequality_expression)
```

Run this code to obtain the simplified inequality expression. Once we have it, we can determine the next steps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Inequality expression (LHS - RHS): -x**2 - 17*x - 42

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The simplified expression from subtracting the RHS from the LHS is correct:

Inequality Expression: $-x^2 - 17x - 42$

Next, we will factor this expression to determine the critical points where the expression equals zero.

```python
from sympy import factor

# Factor the inequality expression
factored_expression = factor(inequality_expression)

# Print the factored inequality expression
print("Factored Inequality Expression:", factored_expression)
```

Please run this code to obtain the critical points, and we will continue from there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Factored Inequality Expression: -(x + 3)*(x + 14)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The factored form of the inequality expression is correct:

Factored Inequality Expression: $-(x + 3)(x + 14)$

The critical points are the values of $x$ for which this expression equals zero, which are $x = -3$ and $x = -14$.

Now, we will determine the intervals formed by these critical points and analyze the sign of the inequality expression within each interval to find where the original inequality holds true.

```python
from sympy import solveset, S

# Determine in which intervals the inequality holds true
solution_intervals = solveset(inequality_expression < 0, x, domain=S.Reals)

# Print the solution in interval notation
print("Solution Intervals:", solution_intervals)
```

Running this code will provide us with the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, expressed in interval notation. Please execute it to get the final answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Solution Intervals: Union(Interval.open(-oo, -14), Interval.open(-3, oo))

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The solution intervals where the original inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$ holds true are:

Solution Intervals: $(-\infty, -14) \cup (-3, \infty)$

So the complete solution to the problem in interval notation is:

$$\boxed{(-\infty, -14) \cup (-3, \infty)}$$

This indicates that the inequality is satisfied for all $x$ values less than $-14$ and for all $x$ values greater than $-3$.

### Example 2

Problem: For what negative value of $k$ is there exactly one solution to
the system of equations

Correct Solution: Setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each
other, it follows that $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$. Re-arranging,
$2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$. For there to be exactly one solution for $x$,
then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero.
Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so
$k+1 = \pm 4$. Taking the negative value, $k = \boxed{-5}$.

```python
math_problem = "For what negative value of $k$ is there exactly one solution to the system of equations \\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\\\\ny &= -x + 4?\n\\end{align*}"

Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.

```python

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

Problem:
For what negative value of $k$ is there exactly one solution to the system of equations \begin{align*}
y &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\
y &= -x + 4?
\end{align*}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The key idea to solve this problem is to set the two equations equal to each other and find the value of $k$ such that the resulting quadratic equation has exactly one solution. A quadratic equation has exactly one solution if and only if its discriminant is zero.

The system of equations is:
\begin{align*}
y &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \quad (1) \\
y &= -x + 4 \quad (2)
\end{align*}

Setting these two equations equal to each other gives us:
$$ 2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4. $$

Now, we simplify the equation and equate it to zero to form a quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:
$$ 2x^2 + (k + 1)x + (6 - 4) = 0. $$

The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. For there to be exactly one solution, we need $\Delta = 0$. We will determine the value of $k$ that makes the discriminant zero.

Let's calculate the discriminant with the values we have:
\begin{align*}
a &= 2, \\
b &= k + 1, \\
c &= 2.
\end{align*}

The discriminant is then:
$$ \Delta = (k + 1)^2 - 4(2)(2). $$

We set the discriminant equal to zero and solve for $k$:
$$ (k + 1)^2 - 16 = 0. $$

I will now write a Python code using sympy to solve for $k$:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the symbol k
k = symbols('k')

# Define the discriminant
discriminant = (k + 1)**2 - 4*2*2

# Equation for the discriminant to be zero
eq = Eq(discriminant, 0)

# Solve for k
k_value = solve(eq, k)
print("The value of k for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations is:", k_value)
```

Running this code will give us the negative value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

The value of k for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations is: [-5, 3]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

Given that we are interested in the negative value of \(k\) which results in exactly one solution to the system of equations, from the two values you've reported \([-5, 3]\), the negative value is \(-5\).

Thus, the correct value of \(k\) is \(-5\).

We can insert this result into a boxed format:

\[
\boxed{k = -5}
\]

### Example 3

Problem: Find all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation
$x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in
decreasing order, separated by commas.

Correct Solution: For the roots to be real and rational, the
discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore,
$(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only
positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and
$36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$,
and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and
$49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are
$\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Problem:
Find all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in decreasing order, separated by commas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

To solve this problem, we want to find all positive integer values of $c$ for which the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ has real and rational roots. For this, we need to use the discriminant of a quadratic equation, which is given by the formula $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. For the equation to have real and rational roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

In the given equation, $a=1, b=-7$, and $c$ is the constant we're looking for. 

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Write the discriminant condition for the equation to have real and rational roots.
2. Find the range of possible $c$ values by considering the constraints.
3. Enumerate through possible $c$ values to find the ones where the discriminant is a perfect square.
4. Return the values of $c$ in decreasing order, separated by commas.

Let's start with step one and use Python to find all $c$ values that satisfy the condition for $\Delta$ being a perfect square:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve

# Define the variable
c = symbols('c', integer=True)

# The discriminant of the quadratic equation
discriminant = (-7)**2 - 4*1*c

# List to hold all possible c values with rational roots
c_values = []

# Finding the range for c:
# Since c is positive and we want the discriminant to be non-negative (to have real roots),
# the smallest possible square for the discriminant is 0, which gives us the upper bound for c.
upper_bound = solve(discriminant, c)[0]

# Check all integer values up to the upper bound
for i in range(1, upper_bound + 1):
    # If the discriminant is a perfect square, then the roots will be rational.
    if ((-7)**2 - 4*1*i).is_square:
        c_values.append(i)

# Output the result in decreasing order
c_values.sort(reverse=True)
print(', '.join(map(str, c_values)))
```

This code will output all positive integer values of $c$ for which the roots of the equation are real and rational, sorted in decreasing order.

Error: Traceback (most recent call last):

    upper_bound = solve(discriminant, c)[0]
IndexError: list index out of range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

I apologize for the confusion in the earlier Python code. Let me correct the code by directly computing the upper bound for $c$. Since we are looking for positive integer values of $c$, we can infer that for $c > (\frac{7}{2})^2$, the discriminant will start to become negative, thus no longer yielding real roots. Therefore, the upper bound for $c$ will be $\left\lfloor(\frac{7}{2})^2\right\rfloor = 12$. Let's modify the code to reflect this new approach.

Firstly, it's important to note that the discriminant, $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$, must be a non-negative perfect square for the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to have real and rational roots. In our case, $a = 1$ and $b = -7$, so we have $\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4c = 49 - 4c$.

We also know that a perfect square is always non-negative, so $49 - 4c \geq 0$. From this inequality, we can find the upper bound for the value of $c$. Now, let's implement this as Python code:

```python
# Define the variable and the list to store valid c values
upper_bound = (7**2) // 4  # This is the floor division of 49 by 4, which yields 12
c_values = []

# Iterate over the possible c values and check if the discriminant is a perfect square
for i in range(1, upper_bound + 1):
    discriminant = 49 - 4 * i
    # Check if the discriminant is a non-negative perfect square
    if discriminant >= 0 and (int(discriminant**0.5))**2 == discriminant:
        c_values.append(i)

# Output the result in decreasing order
c_values.sort(reverse=True)
print(', '.join(map(str, c_values)))
```

This corrected code will enumerate through all possible $c$ values starting from 1 up to the calculated upper bound, checking whether the discriminant is a perfect square for each value of $c$. It will output the valid $c$ values in decreasing order, as the problem requests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mathproxyagent (to assistant):

12, 10, 6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to mathproxyagent):

The correct values for $c$ in decreasing order are indeed $12, 10, 6$. This is because these values of $c$ result in discriminants of $49 - 4c$ that are perfect squares, specifically $1$, $9$, and $25$ respectively, which correspond to the real, rational roots of the quadratic equation given by $x^2 - 7x + c = 0$.

So, we can express the final answer as:

\[
\boxed{12, 10, 6}
\]

We’ve established that $x = -23$.

Next, we can substitute the value of $x$ into either of the original
equations to solve for $y$. Let’s substitute $x$ into the first
equation:

$$
725x + 727y = 1500
$$

Substituting $x = -23$ gives us:

$$
725(-23) + 727y = 1500
$$

Now we’ll solve for $y$ using this equation. The Python code for this
step is:

```python
# Substitute x into the first original equation to solve for y
x_value = -23

# Define the equation
eq_for_y = Eq(725 * x_value + 727 * y, 1500)

# Solve for y
y_value = solve(eq_for_y, y)

print(y_value)
```

Please execute this code to calculate the value of $y$.

## Example 5 (Use the “two_tools” prompt)

Problem: Find all numbers $a$ for which the graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the
graph of $y=ax$ intersect. Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Solution: If these two graphs intersect then the points of
intersection occur when \[x^2+a=ax,\] or \[x^2-ax+a=0.\] This quadratic
has solutions exactly when the discriminant is nonnegative:
\[(-a)^2-4a.\] This simplifies to \[a(a-4).\] This quadratic (in $a$) is
nonnegative when $a$ and $a-4$ are either both $\ge 0$ or both $\le 0$.
This is true for $a$ in $$(-\infty,0]\cup[4,\infty).$$ Therefore the
line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in
$\boxed{(-\infty,0]\cup[4,\infty)}$.

```python
# The wolfram alpha app id is required for this example (the assistant may choose to query Wolfram Alpha).
if "WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID"] = open("wolfram.txt").read().strip()

# we set the prompt_type to "two_tools", which allows the assistant to select wolfram alpha when necessary.
