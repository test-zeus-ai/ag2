AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which
can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This
framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieval-augmented code
generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how
to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on
customized documentations that are not present in the LLM’s training
dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of
`AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g.,
[Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution &
Debugging](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)).
Essentially, `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply
mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.

## Table of Contents

We’ll demonstrate six examples of using RetrieveChat for code generation
and question answering:

## Construct agents for RetrieveChat

We start by initializing the `AssistantAgent` and
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent`. The system message needs to be set to “You are
a helpful assistant.” for AssistantAgent. The detailed instructions are
given in the user message. Later we will use the
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent.message_generator` to combine the instructions
and a retrieval augmented generation task for an initial prompt to be
sent to the LLM assistant.

```python
print("Accepted file formats for `docs_path`:")
print(TEXT_FORMATS)
```

``` text
Accepted file formats for `docs_path`:
['yaml', 'ppt', 'rst', 'jsonl', 'xml', 'txt', 'yml', 'log', 'rtf', 'msg', 'xlsx', 'htm', 'pdf', 'org', 'pptx', 'md', 'docx', 'epub', 'tsv', 'csv', 'html', 'doc', 'odt', 'json']
```

```python
# 1. create an AssistantAgent instance named "assistant"
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant. You must always reply with some form of text.",

### Example 1

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Use RetrieveChat to help generate sample code and automatically run the
code and fix errors if there is any.

Problem: Which API should I use if I want to use FLAML for a
classification task and I want to train the model in 30 seconds. Use
spark to parallel the training. Force cancel jobs if time limit is
reached.

```python
# reset the assistant. Always reset the assistant before starting a new conversation.
assistant.reset()

# given a problem, we use the ragproxyagent to generate a prompt to be sent to the assistant as the initial message.
# the assistant receives the message and generates a response. The response will be sent back to the ragproxyagent for processing.
# The conversation continues until the termination condition is met, in RetrieveChat, the termination condition when no human-in-loop is no code block detected.
# With human-in-loop, the conversation will continue until the user says "exit".
code_problem = "How can I use FLAML to perform a classification task and use spark to do parallel training. Train for 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached."
chat_result = ragproxyagent.initiate_chat(
    assistant, message=ragproxyagent.message_generator, problem=code_problem, search_string="spark"

ragproxyagent (to assistant):

You're a retrieve augmented coding assistant. You answer user's questions based on your own knowledge and the
context provided by the user.
If you can't answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.
For code generation, you must obey the following rules:
Rule 1. You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.
Rule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```language
# your code
```

User's question is: How can I use FLAML to perform a classification task and use spark to do parallel training. Train for 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.

Context is: # Integrate - Spark

FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:

- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.
- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.

## Spark ML Estimators

FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.

### Data

For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.

This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.

This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.

- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.
- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)

Here is an example code snippet for Spark Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark

# Creating a dictionary
data = {
    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],
    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],
    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],
}

# Creating a pandas DataFrame
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
label = "Price"

# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)
```

To use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

columns = psdf.columns
feature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]
featurizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
psdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]
```

Later in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.

### Estimators

#### Model List

- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.

#### Usage

First, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.

By including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.

Here is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:

```python
import flaml

# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned

automl = flaml.AutoML()
settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional
    "task": "regression",
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=psdf,
    label=label,
    **settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```

assistant (to ragproxyagent):

Based on the provided context which details the integration of Spark with FLAML for distributed training, and the requirement to perform a classification task with parallel training in Spark, here's a code snippet that configures FLAML to train a classification model for 30 seconds and cancels the jobs if the time limit is reached.

```python
from flaml import AutoML
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark
import pandas as pd

# Your pandas DataFrame 'data' goes here
# Assuming 'data' is already a pandas DataFrame with appropriate data for classification
# and 'label_column' is the name of the column that we want to predict.

# First, convert your pandas DataFrame to a pandas-on-spark DataFrame
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(data)

# Now, we prepare the settings for the AutoML training with Spark
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,  # Train for 30 seconds
    "metric": "accuracy",  # Assuming you want to use accuracy as the metric
    "task": "classification",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,  # Adjust the number of concurrent trials depending on your cluster setup
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Force cancel jobs if time limit is reached
}

# Create an AutoML instance
automl = AutoML()

# Run the AutoML search
# You need to replace 'psdf' with your actual pandas-on-spark DataFrame variable
# and 'label_column' with the name of your label column
automl.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label_column, **automl_settings)
```

This code snippet assumes that the `data` variable contains the pandas DataFrame you want to classify and that `label_column` is the name of the target variable for the classification task. Make sure to replace 'data' and 'label_column' with your actual data and label column name before running this code.

# Integrate - Spark

FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:

- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.
- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.

## Spark ML Estimators

FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.

### Data

For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.

This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.

This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.

- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.
- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)

Here is an example code snippet for Spark Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark

# Creating a dictionary
data = {
    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],
    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],
    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],
}

# Creating a pandas DataFrame
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
label = "Price"

# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)
```

To use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

columns = psdf.columns
feature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]
featurizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
psdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]
```

Later in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.

### Estimators

#### Model List

- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.

#### Usage

First, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.

By including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.

Here is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:

```python
import flaml

# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned

automl = flaml.AutoML()
settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional
    "task": "regression",
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=psdf,
    label=label,
    **settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```

# Integrate - Spark

FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:

- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.
- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.

## Spark ML Estimators

FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.

### Data

For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.

This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.

This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.

- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.
- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)

Here is an example code snippet for Spark Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark

# Creating a dictionary
data = {
    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],
    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],
    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],
}

# Creating a pandas DataFrame
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
label = "Price"

# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)
```

To use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

columns = psdf.columns
feature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]
featurizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
psdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]
```

Later in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.

### Estimators

#### Model List

- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.

#### Usage

First, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.

By including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.

Here is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:

```python
import flaml

# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned

automl = flaml.AutoML()
settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional
    "task": "regression",
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=psdf,
    label=label,
    **settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```
