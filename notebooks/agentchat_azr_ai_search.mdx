This notebook demonstrates the use of Assistant Agents in conjunction
with Azure Cognitive Search and Azure Identity. Assistant Agents use
tools that interact with Azure Cognitive Search to extract pertinent
data.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, please ensure the following prerequisites
are met:

### Dependencies

1.  **Autogen**
2.  **Azure SDK**
3.  **Cognitive Search**/**AI Search**

If you have AI search enabled in your Azure Portal, you can use the
following code to create an assistant agent that can search Azure
Cognitive Search.

**AI search setup details:** - Documentation:  
- Create search service:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal -
Search index:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-how-to-create-search-index?tabs=portal
hybrid search:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-how-to-query

### Install Azure CLI

This notebook requires the Azure CLI for authentication purposes. Follow
these steps to install and configure it:

1.  **Download and Install Azure CLI**:
    -   Visit the [Azure CLI installation
        page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
        and follow the instructions for your operating system.
    -   Mac users can install Azure CLI using Homebrew with the command
        `brew install azure-cli`
2.  **Verify Installation**:
    -   In the below cell execute `az --version` to check if Azure CLI
        is installed correctly.
3.  **Login to Azure**:
    -   In the below cell execute `az login` to log into your Azure
        account. This step is necessary as the notebook uses
        `AzureCliCredential` which retrieves the token based on the
        Azure account currently logged in.

### Check Azure CLI Installation

Run the cell below to check if Azure CLI is installed and properly
configured on your system.

## Check Azure CLI Installation and Login Status

```python
# Check Azure CLI installation and login status
# !az --version
# !az login
```

## Install required packages

Run the cell below to install the required packages for this notebook.

```python
!pip3 install pyautogen==0.2.16
!pip3 install python-dotenv==1.0.1
!pip3 install pyautogen[graph]>=0.2.11
!pip3 install azure-search-documents==11.4.0b8
!pip3 install azure-identity==1.12.0
```

Next you will import the required packages for this notebook.

```python
import json
import os

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.search.documents import SearchClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

import autogen
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, register_function
from autogen.cache import Cache

load_dotenv()

# Import Cognitive Search index ENV
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE")
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX")
AZURE_SEARCH_KEY = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_KEY")
AZURE_SEARCH_API_VERSION = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_API_VERSION")
AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CONFIG = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CONFIG")
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT = os.getenv("AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT")
```

Next, you need to authenticate and create a `SearchClient` instance.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
endpoint = AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT

from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

credential = AzureCliCredential()
token = credential.get_token("https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")

print("TOKEN", token.token)

client = SearchClient(endpoint=endpoint, index_name="test-index", credential=credential)
```

Then, load the configuration list and define the configuration for the
`AssistantAgent`.

```python
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
)

gpt4_config = {
    "cache_seed": 42,
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
}
```

Define your tool function `search` that will interact with the Azure
Cognitive Search service.

```python
def search(query: str):
    payload = json.dumps(
        {
            "search": query,
            "vectorQueries": [{"kind": "text", "text": query, "k": 5, "fields": "vector"}],
            "queryType": "semantic",
            "semanticConfiguration": AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CONFIG,
            "captions": "extractive",
            "answers": "extractive|count-3",
            "queryLanguage": "en-US",
        }
    )

    response = list(client.search(payload))

    output = []
    for result in response:
        result.pop("titleVector")
        result.pop("contentVector")
        output.append(result)

    return output
```

Define the `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` instances, and register
the `search` function to them.

```python
cog_search = AssistantAgent(
    name="COGSearch",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant. "
    "You can help with Azure Cognitive Search."
    "Return 'TERMINATE' when the task is done.",
    llm_config=gpt4_config,
)

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    llm_config=False,
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: msg.get("content") is not None and "TERMINATE" in msg["content"],
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

register_function(
    search,
    caller=cog_search,
    executor=user_proxy,
    name="search",
    description="A tool for searching the Cognitive Search index",
)
```

Finally, initiate a chat.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":

    async def main():
        with Cache.disk() as cache:
            await user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(
                cog_search,
                message="Search for 'What is Azure?' in the 'test-index' index",
                cache=cache,
            )

    await main()
```
