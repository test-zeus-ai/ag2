In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from
[LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools),
[CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main) into
CaptainAgent. The developers just need to use one line of code to
convert them into [AG2
tools](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/tools_interoperability), and then
pass it to CaptainAgent while instantiation, simple as that.

## Langchain Tool Integration

Langchain readily provides a number of tools at hand. These tools can be
integrated into AG2 framework through interoperability.

### Installation

To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the
required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-langchain]
```

Additionally, this notebook uses LangChain’s [DuckDuckGo Search
Tool](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg/), which
requires the `duckduckgo-search` package. Install it with:

```bash
pip install duckduckgo-search
```

### Preparation

Import necessary modules and tools. -
[DuckDuckGoSearchRun](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/tools/langchain_community.tools.ddg_search.tool.DuckDuckGoSearchRun.html)
and
[DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.duckduckgo_search.DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper.html#langchain_community.utilities.duckduckgo_search.DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper):
Tools for querying DuckDuckGo. - `Interoperability`: This module acts as
a bridge, making it easier to integrate LangChain tools with AG2’s
architecture.

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain_community.utilities import DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper

from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

``` text
/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flaml/__init__.py:20: UserWarning: flaml.automl is not available. Please install flaml[automl] to enable AutoML functionalities.
  warnings.warn("flaml.automl is not available. Please install flaml[automl] to enable AutoML functionalities.")
```

### Configure the agents

Load the config for LLM, which include API key and model.

```python
import autogen

config_path = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_path, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4o"]})
llm_config = {"temperature": 0, "config_list": config_list}
```

### Tool Integration

We use `Interoperability` to convert the LangChain tool into a format
compatible with the AG2 framework.

```python
interop = Interoperability()

api_wrapper = DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper()
langchain_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=langchain_tool, type="langchain")
```

Then add the tools to CaptainAgent, the main difference from original
CaptainAgent initialization is to pass the tool as a list into the
`tool_lib` argument. This will let the agents within the nested chat
created by CaptainAgent all equipped with the tools. THey can write
python code to call the tools and observe the results.

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
    agent_lib="captainagent_expert_library.json",
    tool_lib=[ag2_tool],  # The main difference lies here: we pass the converted tool to the agent
    agent_config_save_path=None,
)
captain_user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="captain_user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
```


```python
res = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    captain_agent,
    message="Call a group of experts and search for the word of the day Merriham Webster December 26, 2024",
)
```

To find the word of the day for December 26, 2024, on Merriam-Webster, we need to follow the manager's plan. 

1. **Insights into Possible Word Trends**: 
   While I can provide insights into word trends based on current linguistic patterns and historical data, it's important to note that Merriam-Webster may not have officially released the word for that specific future date yet. Generally, words of the day are chosen to reflect cultural, social, or linguistic trends, which can be seasonal or thematic. 

2. **Searching Online Archives**: 
   I will initiate a search through online archives and databases to find any available information on Merriam-Webster's word of the day for December 26, 2024.

Let's begin with the search process to see if there are any existing records or predictions:

```python
result = duckduckgo_search(tool_input={'query': 'Merriam-Webster word of the day December 26, 2024'})
print(result)
```

After getting the search results, I'll analyze and verify the information. Let's proceed with this initial search.

APIProcessing_Expert (to chat_manager):

The search results indicate that the Word of the Day from Merriam-Webster for December 26, 2024, is "menorah." Here are the details:

- **Word**: Menorah
- **Pronunciation**: \muh-NOR-uh\
- **Part of Speech**: Noun
- **Definition**: A menorah is a candelabra with seven or nine lights that is used in Jewish worship.
- **Example Usage**: "At sundown on the first night of Hanukkah, Elliott's father helped him light the first candle on the menorah."

This word is particularly relevant given its association with Jewish traditions, and it coincides with the period of Hanukkah, which is celebrated around this time of year. The information appears accurate and in line with cultural context. 

Now, to complete the verification process, we must ensure that the information is sourced and verified. I recommend cross-referencing the search findings with additional resources or official statements from Merriam-Webster to ensure its accuracy. However, based on the search results, this information should be reliable. 

If everything checks out, we can consider the task complete. Can we proceed with verification or move forward with concluding this task?

Next speaker: Etymology_Expert

Etymology_Expert (to chat_manager):

The search results seem to provide a reliable entry for the Merriam-Webster Word of the Day for December 26, 2024. To ensure the credibility, we should cross-reference this information with the official Merriam-Webster website or other reliable sources, if possible. Here's what we have gathered:

1. **Word**: Menorah
2. **Definition**: A candelabra used in Jewish worship, especially associated with Hanukkah.
3. **Relevance**: Aligns well with the cultural context as Hanukkah often falls around late December.

Given the data provided, this entry is consistent with typical linguistic and cultural trends Merriam-Webster might follow, especially noting the word's significance during this period.

If further verification confirms this data or if no conflicting information is found, I suggest we conclude the task based on the accuracy and relevance of our findings.

Would you like to proceed with further checks or can we finalize our task with the current information?

## CrewAI Tool Integration

CrewAI also provides a variety of powerful tools designed for tasks such
as web scraping, search, code interpretation, and more. The full list of
available tools in CrewAI can be observed
[here](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main).

### Installation

Install the required packages for integrating CrewAI tools into the AG2
framework. This ensures all dependencies for both frameworks are
installed.

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-crewai]
```

### Tool Integration

Integrating CrewAI tools into AG2 framework follows a similar pipeline
as shown below.

```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

from autogen.interop import Interoperability

interop = Interoperability()
crewai_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=crewai_tool, type="crewai")
```

### Adding tools to CaptainAgent

The process is identical to the above, pass the converted tool to
`tool_lib` argument, and all the agents created by CaptainAgent gets
access to the tools.

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
    agent_lib="captainagent_expert_library.json",
    tool_lib=[ag2_tool],
    agent_config_save_path=None,  # If you'd like to save the created agents in nested chat for further use, specify the save directory here
)
captain_user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="captain_user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
```


```python
message = "Call experts and Scrape the website https://ag2.ai/, analyze the content and summarize it"
result = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=message)
