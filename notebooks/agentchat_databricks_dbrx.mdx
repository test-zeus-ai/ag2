In March 2024, Databricks released
[DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm),
a general-purpose LLM that sets a new standard for open LLMs. While
available as an open-source model on Hugging Face
([databricks/dbrx-instruct](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct/tree/main)
and [databricks/dbrx-base](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base)
), customers of Databricks can also tap into the [Foundation Model
APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html#query-a-chat-completion-model),
which make DBRX available through an OpenAI-compatible, autoscaling REST
API.

[Autogen](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) is becoming a
popular standard for agent creation. Built to support any “LLM as a
service” that implements the OpenAI SDK, it can easily be extended to
integrate with powerful open source models.

This notebook will demonstrate a few basic examples of Autogen with
DBRX, including the use of `AssistantAgent`, `UserProxyAgent`, and
`ConversableAgent`. These demos are not intended to be exhaustive - feel
free to use them as a base to build upon!

## Requirements

AutoGen must be installed on your Databricks cluster, and requires
`Python>=3.9`. This example includes the `%pip` magic command to
install: `%pip install pyautogen`, as well as other necessary libraries.

This code has been tested on: \* [Serverless
Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/serverless.html) (in
public preview as of Apr 18, 2024) \* Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS ML
[docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/release-notes/runtime/14.3lts-ml.html)

This code can run in any Databricks workspace in a region where DBRX is
available via pay-per-token APIs (or provisioned throughput). To check
if your region is supported, see [Foundation Model Region
Availability](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/model-serving-limits.html#foundation-model-apis-limits).
If the above is true, the workspace must also be enabled by an admin for
Foundation Model APIs
[docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html#requirements).

## Tips

-   This notebook can be imported from github to a Databricks workspace
    and run directly. Use [sparse checkout mode with
    git](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/01/26/work-large-monorepos-sparse-checkout-support-databricks-repos.html)
    to import only this notebook or the examples directory.

-   Databricks recommends using
    [Secrets](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html)
    instead of storing tokens in plain text.

## Contributor

```python
%pip install pyautogen==0.2.25 openai==1.21.2 typing_extensions==4.11.0 --upgrade
```

``` text
```

It is recommended to restart the Python kernel after installs -
uncomment and run the below:

```python
# dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

## Setup DBRX config list

See Autogen docs for more inforation on the use of `config_list`: [LLM
Configuration](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/llm_configuration#why-is-it-a-list)

```python
import os

# Set environment variables with your current workspace host and a personal access token
# To a secret you have already set up: dbutils.secrets.get('your_scope_name','databricks_host')

# DATABRICKS_HOST format: "https://{your workspace url}" (no trailing slash)
## AWS Workspace example: "https://my-databricks-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
## Azure Workspace example: "https://adb-123456790123.12.azuredatabricks.net"
os.environ["DATABRICKS_HOST"] = "<FILL IN WITH YOUR WORKSPACE URL IN SUPPORTED DBRX REGION>"

# DATABRICKS_TOKEN format: "dapi..."
## Temp token: dbutils.notebook.entry_point.getDbutils().notebook().getContext().apiToken().get()
os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = "dapi...."

llm_config = {
    "config_list": [
        {
            "model": "databricks-dbrx-instruct",
            "api_key": str(os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"]),
            "base_url": str(os.getenv("DATABRICKS_HOST")) + "/serving-endpoints",
        }
    ],
}
```

## Hello World Example

Our first example will be with a simple `UserProxyAgent` asking a
question to an `AssistantAgent`. This is based on the tutorial demo
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/tutorial/introduction).

After sending the question and seeing a response, you can type `exit` to
end the chat or continue to converse.

```python
import autogen

# Create Assistant and User
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name="user", code_execution_config=False)

# Initiate chat from user_proxy side
chat_result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="What is MLflow?")
```

```` text
user (to assistant):

What is MLflow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user):

Sure, I'd be happy to explain MLflow to you. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing machine learning workflows. It was developed by Databricks and was open-sourced in 2018. MLflow provides a number of features to help data scientists and machine learning engineers manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including:

1. **MLflow Tracking**: This is a logging API that allows you to record and query experiments, including code, data, config, and results.
2. **MLflow Projects**: This is a format for packaging reusable and reproducible data science code, which can be run on different platforms.
3. **MLflow Models**: This is a convention for packaging machine learning models in multiple formats, making it easy to deploy in different environments.
4. **MLflow Model Registry**: This is a central repository to store, manage, and serve machine learning models.

Here is a Python code example of how you might use MLflow Tracking to log a simple experiment:
```python
# filename: mlflow_example.py

import mlflow
import numpy as np

# Log a parameter (e.g., number of trees in a random forest)
mlflow.log_param("num_trees", 100)

# Log a metric (e.g., accuracy of a model)
accuracy = np.random.rand()
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

# Log the model
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

# End the run
mlflow.end_run()
```
To run this code, you would need to have MLflow installed and running on your machine. You can install MLflow using pip:
```
pip install mlflow
```
Then, you can run the code using the following command:
```
python mlflow_example.py
```
This will create a new experiment in MLflow and log the parameters, metrics, and model. You can then view the experiment in the MLflow UI.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Provide feedback to assistant. Press enter to skip and use auto-reply, or type 'exit' to end the conversation:  exit
```

## Simple Coding Agent

In this example, we will implement a “coding agent” that can execute
code. You will see how this code is run alongside your notebook in your
current workspace, taking advantage of the performance benefits of
Databricks clusters. This is based off the demo
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/non-openai-models/cloud-mistralai).

First, set up a directory:

```python
from pathlib import Path

workdir = Path("coding")
print(workdir)
workdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=workdir)
```

``` text
coding
```

Next, setup our agents and initiate a coding problem. Notice how the
`UserProxyAgent` will take advantage of our `code_executor`; after the
code is shown on screen, type Return/Enter in the chatbox to have it
execute locally on your cluster via the bot’s auto-reply.

**Note**: with generative AI coding assistants, you should **always**
manually read and review the code before executing it yourself, as LLM
results are non-deterministic and may lead to unintended consequences.

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Setting up the agents.
user_proxy_agent = UserProxyAgent(
    name="User",
    code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor},
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "TERMINATE" in msg.get("content"),
)

assistant_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="DBRX Assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

chat_result = user_proxy_agent.initiate_chat(
    assistant_agent,
    message="Count how many prime numbers from 1 to 10000.",
)
```

```` text
User (to DBRX Assistant):

Count how many prime numbers from 1 to 10000.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DBRX Assistant (to User):

Sure, I can help you with that. We can write a Python script to count the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000. Here's the script:

```python
# filename: count_primes.py

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_primes(end):
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, end + 1):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return count

print(count_primes(10000))
```

This script first defines a helper function `is_prime(n)` to check if a number `n` is prime. Then, it defines the main function `count_primes(end)` to count the number of prime numbers up to `end`. Finally, it prints the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.

To run the script, save it to a file named `count_primes.py`, and then execute it using the command `python count_primes.py` in a terminal or command prompt. The script will print the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or errors when running the script.

User (to DBRX Assistant):

exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output: 1229


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DBRX Assistant (to User):

Great! The execution succeeded and the output is 1229, which is the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000. This means that there are 1229 prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000.

To verify the result, we can manually check the prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000. Here are the first few prime numbers:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199,...

We can see that there are indeed 1229 prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000.

Therefore, the output of the script is correct and the task is solved.

    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
```

## Conversable Bots

We can also implement the [two-agent chat
pattern](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/tutorial/conversation-patterns#two-agent-chat-and-chat-result)
using DBRX to “talk to itself” in a teacher/student exchange:

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent

# Setting up the agents.
student_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="Student_Agent",
    system_message="You are a student willing to learn.",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

teacher_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="Teacher_Agent",
    system_message="You are a computer science teacher.",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

# Initiate chat
chat_result = student_agent.initiate_chat(
    teacher_agent,
    message="How does deep learning relate to artificial intelligence?",
    summary_method="last_msg",
    max_turns=1,  # Set to higher number to control back and forth
)
```

``` text
Student_Agent (to Teacher_Agent):

How does deep learning relate to artificial intelligence?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
Teacher_Agent (to Student_Agent):

Hello there! I'm glad you asked about the relationship between deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).

Deep learning is actually a subset of AI, which is a broader field dedicated to creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Other subsets of AI include rule-based systems, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among others.

Deep learning, on the other hand, is a specific approach to building AI systems that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In deep learning, we use artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons," to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Deep learning has been particularly successful in recent years due to several factors, including the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computational resources, and advances in neural network architectures and training algorithms. As a result, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

So, in summary, deep learning is a specific approach to building AI systems that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to its impressive performance on a variety of tasks. However, it is just one of many approaches to building AI systems, and it is important to understand the broader context of AI in order to fully appreciate the potential and limitations of deep learning.

## Implement Logging Display

It can be useful to display chat logs to the notebook for debugging, and
then persist those logs to a Delta table. The following section
demonstrates how to extend the default AutoGen logging libraries.

First, we will implement a Python `class` that extends the capabilities
of `autogen.runtime_logging`
[docs](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/agentchat_logging):

```python
class DatabricksAutoGenLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

        self.spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
        self.logger_config = {"dbname": "logs.db"}

    def start(self):
        import autogen.runtime_logging

        self.logging_session_id = autogen.runtime_logging.start(config=self.logger_config)
        print("Logging session ID: " + str(self.logging_session_id))

    def stop(self):
        import autogen.runtime_logging

        autogen.runtime_logging.stop()

    def _get_log(self, dbname="logs.db", table="chat_completions"):
        import sqlite3

        con = sqlite3.connect(dbname)
        query = f"SELECT * from {table} WHERE session_id == '{self.logging_session_id}' ORDER BY end_time DESC"
        cursor = con.execute(query)
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        column_names = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]
        data = [dict(zip(column_names, row)) for row in rows]
        con.close()
        return data

    def display_session(self):
        import pandas as pd

        return pd.DataFrame(self._get_log())

    def persist_results(self, target_delta_table: str, mode="append"):
        import pandas as pd

        # Convert to Spark DF
        sdf = self.spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(self._get_log()))

        try:
            sdf.write.format("delta").mode(mode).saveAsTable(target_delta_table)
            print(f"Logs sucessfully written to table {target_delta_table} in {mode} mode")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Let’s use the class above on our simplest example. Note the addition of
logging `.start()` and `.stop()`, as well as try/except for error
handling.

```python
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name="user", code_execution_config=False)

# Before initiating chat, start logging:
logs = DatabricksAutoGenLogger()
logs.start()
try:
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="What is MLflow?", max_turns=1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
logs.stop()
# Display logs
display(logs.display_session())
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

With this, we have a simple framework to review and persist logs from
our chats! Notice that in the `request` field above, we can also see the
system prompt for the LLM - this can be useful for prompt engineering as
well as debugging.

Note that when you deploy this to Databricks Model Serving, model
responses are auto-logged using [Lakehouse
Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/index.html);
but the above approach provides a simple mechanism to log chats from the
**client side**.

Let’s now persist these results to a Delta table in [Unity
Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html):

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()  # Not needed in Databricks; session pre-provisioned in notebooks

# Use 3-layer namespace: catalog.schema.table. The table will be created if it does not exist.
target_delta_table = "your_catalog.your_schema.autogen_logs"
logs.persist_results(target_delta_table=target_delta_table, mode="append")

# Display current rows in table
display(spark.table(target_delta_table))
```

``` text
Logs sucessfully written to table shared.tjc.autogent_logs in append mode
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

## Closing Thoughts

This notebook provides a few basic examples of using Autogen with DBRX,
and we’re excited to see how you can use this framework alongside
leading open-source LLMs!

### Limitations

-   Databricks Foundation Model API supports other open-source LLMs
    (Mixtral, Llama2, etc.), but the above code has not been tested on
    those.

-   As of April 2024, DBRX does not yet support tool/function calling
    abilities. To discuss this capability further, please reach out to
    your Databricks representative.
