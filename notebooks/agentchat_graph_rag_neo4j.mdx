AG2 provides GraphRAG integration through agent capabilities. This is an
example utilising the integration of Neo4j‚Äôs property graph database
with LlamaIndex‚Äôs graph query engine.


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
To install the LlamaIndex, Neo4j, and document processing dependencies, install with the 'neo4j' extra:

```bash
pip install ag2[neo4j]
```
</Info>
</div>


## Set Configuration and OpenAI API Key

By default, in order to use LlamaIndex with Neo4j you need to have an
OpenAI key in your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

You can utilise an OAI_CONFIG_LIST file and extract the OpenAI API key
and put it in the environment, as will be shown in the following cell.

Alternatively, you can load the environment variable yourself.


<div class="tip">
<Tip>
Learn more about configuring LLMs for agents [here](/docs/topics/llm_configuration).
</Tip>
</div>


```python
import os

import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")

# Put the OpenAI API key into the environment
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = config_list[0]["api_key"]
```

## Key Information: Using Neo4j with LLM Models üöÄ 

> **Important**  
> - **Default Models**: - **Question Answering**: OpenAI‚Äôs `GPT-4o` with
> `temperature=0.0`. - **Embedding**: OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-3-small`.
>
> -   **Customization**: You can change these defaults by setting the
>     following parameters on the `Neo4jGraphQueryEngine`:
>     -   `llm`: Specify a LLM instance with a llm you like.
>     -   `embedding`: Specify a BaseEmbedding instance with a embedding
>         model.
> -   **Reference**
>     -   https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/llms/
>     -   https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/graph_store/

## Create a Knowledge Graph with Your Own Data

**Note:** You need to have a Neo4j database running. If you are running
one in a Docker container, please ensure your Docker network is setup to
allow access to it.

In this example, the Neo4j endpoint is set to host=‚Äúbolt://172.17.0.3‚Äù
and port=7687, please adjust accordingly. For how to spin up a Neo4j
with Docker, you can refer to
[this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/property_graph_neo4j/#:~:text=stores%2Dneo4j-,Docker%20Setup,%C2%B6,-To%20launch%20Neo4j)

We initialise the database with a Word document, creating the Property
graph in Neo4j.

```python
# IMPORTS
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.neo4j_graph_query_engine import Neo4jGraphQueryEngine
```

### A Simple Example

In this example, the graph schema is auto-generated. Entities and
relationship are created as they fit into the data

LlamaIndex supports a lot of extensions including docx, text, pdf, csv,
etc. Find more details in Neo4jGraphQueryEngine. You may need to install
dependencies for each extension. In this example, we need
`pip install docx2txt`

We start by creating a Neo4j property graph (knowledge graph) with a
sample employee handbook of a finctional company called BUZZ

```python
# load documents
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.document import Document, DocumentType

input_path = "../test/agentchat/contrib/graph_rag/BUZZ_Employee_Handbook.docx"
input_documents = [Document(doctype=DocumentType.TEXT, path_or_url=input_path)]
```


```python
# pip install docx2txt
# Auto generate graph schema from unstructured data


# Create Neo4jGraphQueryEngine
query_engine = Neo4jGraphQueryEngine(
    username="neo4j",  # Change if you reset username
    password="password",  # Change if you reset password
    host="bolt://172.17.0.3",  # Change
    port=7687,  # if needed
    llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.0),  # Default, no need to specify
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small"),  # except you want to use a different model
    database="neo4j",  # Change if you want to store the graphh in your custom database
)

# Ingest data and create a new property graph
query_engine.init_db(input_doc=input_documents)
```

Instead of creating a new property graph, if you want to use an existing
graph, you can connect to its database

```python
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.neo4j_graph_query_engine import Neo4jGraphQueryEngine

query_engine = Neo4jGraphQueryEngine(
    username="neo4j",  # Change if you reset username
    password="password",  # Change if you reset password
    host="bolt://172.17.0.3",  # Change
    port=7687,  # if needed
    llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.0),  # Default, no need to specify
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small"),  # except you want to use a different model
    database="neo4j",  # Change if you want to store the graphh in your custom database
)

# Connect to the existing graph
query_engine.connect_db()
```

### Add capability to a ConversableAgent and query them

Notice that we intentionally moved the specific content of Equal
Employment Opportunity Policy into a different document to add later

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.neo4j_graph_rag_capability import Neo4jGraphCapability

# Create a ConversableAgent (no LLM configuration)
graph_rag_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="buzz_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# Associate the capability with the agent
graph_rag_capability = Neo4jGraphCapability(query_engine)
graph_rag_capability.add_to_agent(graph_rag_agent)

# Create a user proxy agent to converse with our RAG agent
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(graph_rag_agent, message="Which company is the employer?")
```

``` text
user_proxy (to buzz_agent):

Which company is the employer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buzz_agent (to user_proxy):

The employer is BUZZ Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_proxy (to buzz_agent):

What policies does it have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buzz_agent (to user_proxy):

BUZZ Co. has several policies, including:

1. Employment Policies and Practices
2. Equal Employment Opportunity
3. Health and Dental Insurance
4. Solicitation Policy

16. Hours of Work Policy

These policies cover a wide range of employment aspects, from leave and separation to confidentiality and security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_proxy (to buzz_agent):

What's Buzz's equal employment opprtunity policy?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buzz_agent (to user_proxy):

The specific content of BUZZ Co.'s Equal Employment Opportunity policy is not provided in the document. However, it is mentioned that BUZZ Co. has an Equal Employment Opportunity policy, which typically would state the company's commitment to providing equal employment opportunities and non-discrimination in the workplace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_proxy (to buzz_agent):

What does Civic Responsibility state?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buzz_agent (to user_proxy):

The document does not provide any information about a Civic Responsibility policy. Therefore, I don't have details on what BUZZ Co.'s Civic Responsibility might state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_proxy (to buzz_agent):

Does Donald Trump work there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buzz_agent (to user_proxy):

The document does not provide any information about specific individuals, including whether Donald Trump works at BUZZ Co. Therefore, I don't have any details on the employment of Donald Trump at BUZZ Co.

```

### Revisit the example by defining custom entities, relations and schema

By providing custom entities, relations and schema, you could guide the
engine to create a graph that better extracts the structure within the
data.

We set `strict=True` to tell the engine to only extracting allowed
relationships from the data for each entity

```python
from typing import Literal

# best practice to use upper-case
entities = Literal["EMPLOYEE", "EMPLOYER", "POLICY", "BENEFIT", "POSITION", "DEPARTMENT", "CONTRACT", "RESPONSIBILITY"]
relations = Literal[
    "FOLLOWS",
    "PROVIDES",
    "APPLIES_TO",
    "DEFINED_AS",
    "ASSIGNED_TO",
    "PART_OF",
    "MANAGES",
    "REQUIRES",
    "ENTITLED_TO",
    "REPORTS_TO",
]

# Define which entities can have which relationships. It can also be used a a guidance if strict is False.
schema = {
    "EMPLOYEE": ["FOLLOWS", "APPLIES_TO", "ASSIGNED_TO", "ENTITLED_TO", "REPORTS_TO"],
    "EMPLOYER": ["PROVIDES", "DEFINED_AS", "MANAGES", "REQUIRES"],
    "POLICY": ["APPLIES_TO", "DEFINED_AS", "REQUIRES"],
    "BENEFIT": ["PROVIDES", "ENTITLED_TO"],
    "POSITION": ["DEFINED_AS", "PART_OF", "ASSIGNED_TO"],
    "DEPARTMENT": ["PART_OF", "MANAGES", "REQUIRES"],
    "CONTRACT": ["PROVIDES", "REQUIRES", "APPLIES_TO"],
    "RESPONSIBILITY": ["ASSIGNED_TO", "REQUIRES", "DEFINED_AS"],
}
```

```python
# Create Neo4jGraphQueryEngine
query_engine = Neo4jGraphQueryEngine(
    username="neo4j",  # Change these as needed

### Add capability to a ConversableAgent and query them again

You should find the answers are much more detailed and accurate since
our schema fits well

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.neo4j_graph_rag_capability import Neo4jGraphCapability

# Create a ConversableAgent (no LLM configuration)
graph_rag_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="rag_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# Associate the capability with the agent
graph_rag_capability = Neo4jGraphCapability(query_engine)
graph_rag_capability.add_to_agent(graph_rag_agent)

# Create a user proxy agent to converse with our RAG agent
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", human_input_mode="ALWAYS", code_execution_config=False)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(graph_rag_agent, message="Which company is the employer?")
```

What is prohibited sexual harassment stated in the policy?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rag_agent (to user_proxy):

Prohibited sexual harassment, as stated in BUZZ Co.'s policy, includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Such conduct is considered prohibited sexual harassment when:

1. Submission to such conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment.
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions.
3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual‚Äôs work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

The policy also encompasses any unwelcome conduct based on other protected characteristics, such as race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, age, national origin, disability status, genetic information, or protected veteran status. Such conduct becomes unlawful when continued employment is made contingent upon the employee's toleration of the offensive conduct, or when the conduct is so severe or pervasive that it creates a work environment that would be considered intimidating, hostile, or abusive by a reasonable person.
