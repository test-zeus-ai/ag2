AG2 provides GraphRAG integration through agent capabilities. This is an
example utilizing the integration of Neo4j’s native GraphRAG SDK. The
Neo4j native query engine enables the construction of a knowledge graph
from a single text or PDF file. Additionally, you can define custom
entities, relationships, or schemas to guide the graph-building process.
Once created, you can integrate the RAG capabilities into AG2 agents to
query the knowledge graph effectively.


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
To install the neo4j GraphRAG SDK with OpenAI LLM

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
pip install pygraphviz
pip install "neo4j-graphrag[openai, experimental]"
```
</Info>
</div>


## Set Configuration and OpenAI API Key

By default, in order to use OpenAI LLM with Neo4j you need to have an
OpenAI key in your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

You can utilize an OAI_CONFIG_LIST file and extract the OpenAI API key
and put it in the environment, as will be shown in the following cell.

Alternatively, you can load the environment variable yourself.


<div class="tip">
<Tip>
Learn more about configuring LLMs for agents [here](/docs/topics/llm_configuration).
</Tip>
</div>


```python
import os

import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")

# Put the OpenAI API key into the environment
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = config_list[0]["api_key"]
```


```python
# This is needed to allow nested asyncio calls for Neo4j in Jupyter
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

# Set up LLM models

**Important**  
- **Default Models**: - **Knowledge Graph Construction** OpenAI’s
`GPT-4o` with `json_object` output `temperature=0.0`. - **Question
Answering**: OpenAI’s `GPT-4o` with `temperature=0.0`. - **Embedding**:
OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-large`. You need to provide its dimension for
the query engine later.

-   **Customization**: You can change these defaults by setting the
    following parameters on the `Neo4jNativeGraphQueryEngine`:
    -   `llm`: Specify a LLM instance with a llm you like for graph
        construction, it **must support json format response**
    -   `query_llm`: Specify a LLM instance with a llm you like for
        querying. **Don’t use json format response.**
    -   `embedding`: Specify a Embedder instance with a embedding model.

Learn more about configuring other LLM providers for agents
[here](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-graphrag-python?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-dependencies).

```python
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.llm.openai_llm import OpenAILLM

llm = OpenAILLM(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    model_params={
        "response_format": {"type": "json_object"},  # Json format response is required for the LLM
        "temperature": 0,
    },
)

query_llm = OpenAILLM(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    model_params={"temperature": 0},  # Don't use json format response for the query LLM
)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")
```


```python
# Imports
from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.document import Document, DocumentType
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.graph_rag.neo4j_native_graph_query_engine import Neo4jNativeGraphQueryEngine

```

## Create a Knowledge Graph with Your Own Data

**Note:** You need to have a Neo4j database running. If you are running
one in a Docker container, please ensure your Docker network is setup to
allow access to it.

In this example, the Neo4j endpoint is set to host=“bolt://172.17.0.3”
and port=7687, please adjust accordingly. For how to spin up a Neo4j
with Docker, you can refer to
[this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/property_graph_neo4j/#:~:text=stores%2Dneo4j-,Docker%20Setup,%C2%B6,-To%20launch%20Neo4j)

### A Simple Example

In this example, the graph schema is auto-generated. Entities and
relationships are created as they fit into the data

Neo4j GraphRAG SDK supports single document of 2 input types – txt and
pdf (images will be skipped).

We start by creating a Neo4j knowledge graph with a sample text.

```python
# load documents
# To use text data, you need to:
# 1. Specify the type as TEXT
# 2. Pass the path to the text file

input_path = "../test/agentchat/contrib/graph_rag/BUZZ_Employee_Handbook.txt"
input_document = [Document(doctype=DocumentType.TEXT, path_or_url=input_path)]
```

First we need to use the query engine to initialize the database. It
performs the follows steps:

1.  Clears the existing database.
2.  Extracts graph nodes and relationships from the input data to build
    a knowledge graph.
3.  Creates a vector index for efficient retrieval.

```python
query_engine = Neo4jNativeGraphQueryEngine(
    host="bolt://172.17.0.3",  # Change
    port=7687,  # if needed
    username="neo4j",  # Change if you reset username
    password="password",  # Change if you reset password
    llm=llm,  # change to the LLM model you want to use
    embeddings=embeddings,  # change to the embeddings model you want to use
    query_llm=query_llm,  # change to the query LLM model you want to use
    embedding_dimension=3072,  # must match the dimension of the embeddings model
)

# initialize the database (it will delete any pre-existing data)
query_engine.init_db(input_document)
```

### Add capability to a ConversableAgent and query them

The rag capability enables the agent to perform local search on the
knowledge graph using the vector index created in the previous step.

```python
# Create a ConversableAgent (no LLM configuration)
graph_rag_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="buzz_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# Associate the capability with the agent
graph_rag_capability = Neo4jNativeGraphCapability(query_engine)
graph_rag_capability.add_to_agent(graph_rag_agent)

# Create a user proxy agent to converse with our RAG agent
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(graph_rag_agent, message="Who is the employer?")
```

``` text

### Revisit the example by defining custom entities, relations and schema

By providing custom entities, relations and schema, you could guide the
engine to create a graph that better extracts the structure within the
data. Custom schema must use provided entities and relations.

```python
# Custom entities, relations and schema that fits the document

entities = ["EMPLOYEE", "EMPLOYER", "POLICY", "BENEFIT", "POSITION", "DEPARTMENT", "CONTRACT", "RESPONSIBILITY"]
relations = [
    "FOLLOWS",
    "PROVIDES",
    "APPLIES_TO",
    "ASSIGNED_TO",
    "PART_OF",
    "REQUIRES",
    "ENTITLED_TO",
    "REPORTS_TO",
]

potential_schema = [
    ("EMPLOYEE", "FOLLOWS", "POLICY"),
    ("EMPLOYEE", "ASSIGNED_TO", "POSITION"),
    ("EMPLOYEE", "REPORTS_TO", "DEPARTMENT"),
    ("EMPLOYER", "PROVIDES", "BENEFIT"),
    ("EMPLOYER", "REQUIRES", "RESPONSIBILITY"),
    ("POLICY", "APPLIES_TO", "EMPLOYEE"),
    ("POLICY", "APPLIES_TO", "CONTRACT"),
    ("POLICY", "REQUIRES", "RESPONSIBILITY"),
    ("BENEFIT", "ENTITLED_TO", "EMPLOYEE"),

    ("POSITION", "ASSIGNED_TO", "EMPLOYEE"),
    ("CONTRACT", "REQUIRES", "RESPONSIBILITY"),
    ("CONTRACT", "APPLIES_TO", "EMPLOYEE"),

The action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. Where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and Neo\'s life in the Matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?). That being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the Matrix plays with your mind. I honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. From the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. However, once the climactic moments hit, I was enthralled. The helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard. I\'m curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start.
