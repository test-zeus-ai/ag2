### UserProxyAgent doesn’t get the correct code

[FLAML](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML) was open sourced in 2020, so
ChatGPT is familiar with it. However, Spark-related APIs were added in
2022, so they were not in ChatGPT’s training data. As a result, we end
up with invalid code.

Senior_Python_Engineer (to chat_manager):

To use Spark for parallel training in FLAML, you need to install `pyspark` package and set up a Spark cluster. Here's some sample code for using Spark in FLAML:

```python
from flaml import AutoML
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("FLAML-Spark").getOrCreate()

# create a FLAML AutoML object with Spark backend
automl = AutoML()

# load data from Spark DataFrame
data = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("data.csv")

# specify the target column and task type
settings = {
    "time_budget": 60, # time budget in seconds
    "metric": 'accuracy',
    "task": 'classification',
}

# train and validate models in parallel using Spark
best_model = automl.fit(data, **settings)

# print the best model and its metadata
print(automl.model_name)
print(automl.best_model)
print(automl.best_config)

# stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()

# terminate the code execution
TERMINATE
```

Note that this is just a sample code, you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

User's question is: How to use spark for parallel training in FLAML? Give me sample code.

Context is: # Integrate - Spark

FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:

- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.
- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.

## Spark ML Estimators

FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.

### Data

For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.

This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.

This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.

- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.
- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)

Here is an example code snippet for Spark Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark

# Creating a dictionary
data = {
    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],
    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],
    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],
}

# Creating a pandas DataFrame
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
label = "Price"

# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)
```

To use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

columns = psdf.columns
feature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]
featurizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
psdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]
```

Later in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.

### Estimators

#### Model List

- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.

#### Usage

First, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.

By including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.

Here is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:

```python
import flaml

# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned

automl = flaml.AutoML()
settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional
    "task": "regression",
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=psdf,
    label=label,
    **settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```

- `lgbm_spark`: The class for fine-tuning Spark version LightGBM models, using [SynapseML](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/docs/features/lightgbm/about/) API.

#### Usage

First, prepare your data in the required format as described in the previous section.

By including the models you intend to try in the `estimators_list` argument to `flaml.automl`, FLAML will start trying configurations for these models. If your input is Spark data, FLAML will also use estimators with the `_spark` postfix by default, even if you haven't specified them.

Here is an example code snippet using SparkML models in AutoML:

```python
import flaml

# prepare your data in pandas-on-spark format as we previously mentioned

automl = flaml.AutoML()
settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # this setting is optional
    "task": "regression",
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=psdf,
    label=label,
    **settings,
)
```

## Parallel Spark Jobs

You can activate Spark as the parallel backend during parallel tuning in both [AutoML](/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#parallel-tuning) and [Hyperparameter Tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#parallel-tuning), by setting the `use_spark` to `true`. FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).

Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.

All the Spark-related arguments are stated below. These arguments are available in both Hyperparameter Tuning and AutoML:

- `use_spark`: boolean, default=False | Whether to use spark to run the training in parallel spark jobs. This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.
- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.
- `force_cancel`: boolean, default=False | Whether to forcely cancel Spark jobs if the search time exceeded the time budget. Spark jobs include parallel tuning jobs and Spark-based model training jobs.

An example code snippet for using parallel Spark jobs:

```python
import flaml

automl_experiment = flaml.AutoML()
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
    "use_spark": True,
    "force_cancel": True,  # Activating the force_cancel option can immediately halt Spark jobs once they exceed the allocated time_budget.
}

automl.fit(
    dataframe=dataframe,
    label=label,
    **automl_settings,
)
```

# Integrate - Spark

FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:

- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.
- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.

## Spark ML Estimators

FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.

### Data

For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.

This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.

This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.

- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.
- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is "distributed-sequence". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)

Here is an example code snippet for Spark Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark

# Creating a dictionary
data = {
    "Square_Feet": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],
    "Age_Years": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],
    "Price": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000],
}

# Creating a pandas DataFrame
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data)
label = "Price"

# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe
psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)
```

To use Spark ML models you need to format your data appropriately. Specifically, use [`VectorAssembler`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler.html) to merge all feature columns into a single vector column.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

columns = psdf.columns
feature_cols = [col for col in columns if col != label]
featurizer = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
psdf = featurizer.transform(psdf.to_spark(index_col="index"))["index", "features"]
```

Later in conducting the experiment, use your pandas-on-spark data like non-spark data and pass them using `X_train, y_train` or `dataframe, label`.

}

automl.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label, **settings)
```
Please adjust the `metric`, `task`, and other settings according to your specific problem and requirements.

Next speaker: Code_Reviewer

Code_Reviewer (to chat_manager):

The provided code snippet is mostly correct and follows the guidelines provided in the context. However, there is one minor issue: if we are using the pandas-on-spark DataFrame `psdf`, the `fit` method should be called with `dataframe` and `label` arguments, not `X_train` and `y_train`.

This is because, with FLAML and Spark integration, the `fit` method expects the entire data as a single pandas-on-spark DataFrame along with the name of the target variable as `label`, rather than being provided with separate feature and target data as it would expect with standard pandas DataFrames.

Here's the correct code snippet reflecting this:

```python
from flaml import AutoML

# Assuming psdf is the pandas-on-spark dataframe and label is the name of the target variable
# Presuming that the data conversion and feature vectorization have been done as shown in the context

automl = AutoML()

settings = {
    "time_budget": 120,  # for example, set the time budget to 2 minutes
    "metric": "accuracy",  # assuming a classification problem, change to "r2" for regression
    "estimator_list": ["lgbm_spark"],  # specify the Spark estimator
    "task": "classification",  # assuming a classification problem, change to "regression" for regression
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,  # number of concurrent Spark jobs
    "use_spark": True,  # enable distributed training using Spark
}

# Use dataframe and label parameters to fit the model
automl.fit(dataframe=psdf, label=label, **settings)
```

Please ensure that your Spark cluster is correctly configured to support distributed training, and adjust the `metric`, `task`, and other settings as needed for your specific use case.

automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 30,
    "metric": "r2",
    "task": "regression",
    "n_concurrent_trials": 2,
