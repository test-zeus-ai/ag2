This is a nested chat re-implementation of
[OptiGuide](https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide), which is an
LLM-based supply chain optimization framework.

In addition to AutoGen, this notebook also requires eventlet and
Gurobipy. The eventlet package is used in this notebook to constrain
code execution with a timeout, and the gurobipy package is a
mathematical optimization software library for solving mixed-integer
linear and quadratic optimization problems.


<div class="info Requirements">

## Step 0. Prepare Helper Functions 

The code cell below includes several helper functions to be used by
agents. The helper functions are adopted directly from
[OptiGuide](https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide).

### Utility Functions

Several utility functions (replace, insert_code, run_with_exec) are
defined to manipulate and execute the source code dynamically:

-   **replace(src_code, old_code, new_code) -\> str:**<br/>Replaces a
    specified block of code within the source code with new code. This
    is essential for updating the code dynamically based on chatbot and
    user interactions.

-   **insert_code(src_code, new_lines) -\> str:**<br/>Determines where
    to insert new lines of code based on specific markers in the source
    code. It’s used to seamlessly integrate generated code snippets.

-   **run_with_exec(src_code) -\> Union\[str,
    Exception\]:**<br/>Executes the modified source code within a
    controlled environment, capturing and returning the output or any
    errors that occur. This function is crucial for testing the
    feasibility and correctness of the generated code solutions.

### Functions External Code Retrieval

The cell also includes logic to retrieve example source code from a
remote repository using the requests library. This example code serves
as a base for the chatbot to work with, allowing users to see real-life
applications of the concepts discussed.

The retrieved code is then displayed, showing both the beginning and the
end of the source code to give a glimpse of its structure and content.

```python
def replace(src_code: str, old_code: str, new_code: str) -> str:
    """Inserts new code into the source code by replacing a specified old
    code block.

    Args:
        src_code (str): The source code to modify.
        old_code (str): The code block to be replaced.
        new_code (str): The new code block to insert.

    Returns:
        str: The modified source code with the new code inserted.

    Raises:
        None

    Example:
        src_code = 'def hello_world():\n    print("Hello, world!")\n\n# Some
        other code here'
        old_code = 'print("Hello, world!")'
        new_code = 'print("Bonjour, monde!")\nprint("Hola, mundo!")'
        modified_code = _replace(src_code, old_code, new_code)
        print(modified_code)
        # Output:
        # def hello_world():

    rst = re.sub(pattern, new_code, src_code)
    return rst


def insert_code(src_code: str, new_lines: str) -> str:
    """Insert a code patch into the source code.

    Args:
        src_code (str): the full source code
        new_lines (str): The new code.

    Returns:
        str: the full source code after insertion (replacement).

    except Exception as e:
        return e

    return ans
```

## Step 1. Agent Construction 

This cell introduces the Writer and OptiGuide agent classes and their
instances to manage the interaction between the user, the chatbot, and
the optimization solver. This streamlines the process of generating,
evaluating, and integrating code solutions for supply chain optimization
problems.

### Classes Defined

-   **`OptiGuide`**: Inherits from `autogen.AssistantAgent` and serves
    as the main class for handling the supply chain optimization logic.
    It maintains state information like the source code, debugging
    attempts left, success status, and user chat history. Key methods
    include `set_success` and `update_debug_times`, which are used to
    update the agent’s state based on the outcomes of interactions.

-   **`Writer`**: Also inherits from `autogen.AssistantAgent`, this
    class is tailored to manage the generation and explanation of Python
    code solutions. It keeps track of the source code and example Q&A to
    assist in generating responses to user queries.

### Agent Instances

-   **`writer`**, **`safeguard`**, and **`optiguide_commander`**:
    Instances of the classes defined above, each configured with
    specific roles in the code generation and evaluation process. These
    agents work together to ensure that the user’s questions are
    answered with safe, optimized, and understandable Python code
    solutions.

-   **`user`**: An instance of `autogen.UserProxyAgent`, representing
    the end-user interacting with the notebook. It’s configured to
    simulate user inputs and responses, facilitating an interactive and
    engaging learning experience.

#### Agent System Messages

Each agent is associted with a corresponding system message. Those
system messages are adopted directly from
[OptiGuide](https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide).

````python

if m.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:
    print(f'Optimal cost: {m.objVal}')
else:
    print("Not solved to optimality. Optimization status:", m.status)
```

## Step 2. Orchestrate Nested Chats 

These three agent instances are orchestrated in the following way with
the `writer` and `safeguard` nested into the `commander` agent as the
inner monologue.

This next cell defines critical functions that manage the interactions
between the `OptiGuide` system, the user, and the internal logic for
processing and responding to queries. Each function plays a specific
role in guiding the conversation, handling code generation requests,
ensuring code safety, and summarizing outcomes. This ensures that agents
receive clear instructions, immediate feedback, and a secure environment
for exploring supply chain optimization problems through code.

Information about the sequence of chats can be specified in the
`chat_queue` argument of the `register_nested_chats` function. The
following fields are especially useful: - `recipient` (required)
specifies the nested agent; - `message` specifies what message to send
to the nested recipient agent. In a sequence of nested chats, if the
`message` field is not specified, we will use the last message the
registering agent received as the initial message in the first chat and
will skip any subsequent chat in the queue that does not have the
`message` field. You can either provide a string or define a callable
that returns a string. - `summary_method` decides what to get out of the
nested chat. You can either select from existing options including
“last_msg” and “reflection_with_llm”, or or define your own way on what
to get from the nested chat with a Callable. - `max_turns` determines
how many turns of conversation to have between the concerned agent
pairs.

```python
def writer_init_messsage(recipient, messages, sender, config):
    if recipient.success:
        return None
    msg_content = messages[-1].get("content", "")
    # board = config
    # get execution result of the original source code
    sender_history = recipient.chat_messages[sender]
    user_chat_history = f"\nHere are the history of discussions:\n{sender_history}"

    if sender.name == "user":

    else:
        execution_result = ""
    writer_sys_msg = (
        WRITER_SYSTEM_MSG.format(

        return SAFEGUARD_SYSTEM_MSG.format(source_code=code) + sender.user_chat_history

        if sender.debug_times_left > 0:
            # Try to debug and write code again (back to step 2)
            sender.debug_times_left -= 1
            return DEBUG_PROMPT.format(error_type=type(execution_rst), error_message=str(execution_rst))

Answer Code:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
writer (to commander):

To answer the user's question regarding the prohibition of shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, we need to add a constraint to the optimization model that sets the shipping quantity `x` for the (`supplier1`, `roastery2`) route to zero. This will effectively disallow any shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2. The code to do this should be placed in the section of the source code that is indicated by the comment "# OPTIGUIDE DATA CODE GOES HERE".

Here's the Python code snippet to add this constraint:

```python
# filename: supply_chain_code.py
model.addConstr(x[('supplier1', 'roastery2')] == 0, "prohibit_supplier1_roastery2")
```

Adding this constraint will prevent the optimizer from selecting any transport from `supplier1` to `roastery2`, which is what the prohibition is intended to achieve.

Instruct the user to add this code snippet in the appropriate place in the source code that they have provided. After adding this code, the `m.optimize()` function will solve the modified version of the problem that includes the new constraint.

--- HUMAN READABLE ANSWER ---


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
writer (to commander):

Certainly! Here's a human-readable answer:

After integrating the constraint to prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the optimization problem was solved with a total cost of $2470.0.

To provide context to this result, we need to compare it with the original total cost prior to the implementation of the new constraint. However, the original total cost was not provided in the information given to me. If the original total cost was known, we would compare the two to understand the financial impact of this constraint on the supply chain.

If prohibiting shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 results in a higher cost than the original scenario, it suggests that the previous ability to ship from supplier 1 to roastery 2 had been cost-effective and beneficial for minimizing overall expenses. On the other hand, if the cost is the same or lower, then shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2 may not have been crucial for the cost optimization of the supply chain, or other routes may have been able to compensate effectively for this restriction.

Without the original cost for comparison, we can't conclusively say how the prohibition impacted the cost of operation. But the new total cost of $2470.0 will be the baseline for future changes or optimizations done following this new restriction.
