### Abstract:

Crypto trading is a multi dimensional 24x7 engagement. With so many tokens launching every day and so much of research to be done for each token, it becomes difficult for an average person or full time trader to perform successful trades and to keep a track of their portfolio and rebalance them as and when the market dynamics shift. In order to solve for this, we created 0xMONK - an autonomous trading agent. This agent takes broad instructions from user on the kind of trades to be done and then monitors the new newly launched tokens and the trending tokens in real time and perform research on them and then makes decisions on whether to buy, sell, hold or pass the tokens. In this talk, we will explore the architecture and underlying principles of 0xMONK. We will see how AG2 framework is leveraged in creating it.
