title: Tool Library
---

In CaptainAgent, tools are in the form of python functions. The agents can write code to import functions and call them according to their needs. This can significantly enhance the functionality and capabilities of the agents.

We provide a list of tools that comes with the release of CaptainAgent. Its full content can be found [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/captainagent/tools/README.md)

## Using the Built-in Tool Library
### Install dependencies
First install the requirements for running the tools via pip.
```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ag2ai/ag2/refs/heads/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/captainagent/tools/requirements.txt
```

### Subscribe to Certain APIs
To use the provided built-in tools, it is required to obtain a Bing Search API key and RapidAPI key.
For Bing API, you can read more about how to get an API on the [Bing Web Search API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api) page.
For RapidAPI, you can [sign up](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up) and subscribe to these two links([link1](https://rapidapi.com/solid-api-solid-api-default/api/youtube-transcript3), [link2](https://rapidapi.com/420vijay47/api/youtube-mp3-downloader2)).
These two apis have free billing options and there is no need to worry about extra costs for small scale runs.

Whenever you run the tool-related code, remember to export the api keys to system variables.
```bash
export BING_API_KEY=""
export RAPID_API_KEY=""
```
or
```python
import os
os.environ["BING_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["RAPID_API_KEY"] = ""
```

Then you are good to go. Feel free to try out the examples provided in the CaptainAgent notebook.

## What is in the Tool Library
The tool library consists of three types of tools: math, data_analysis and information_retrieval. Its folder layout is as follows. Each 'py' file implements a tool.

```
tools
├── README.md
├── data_analysis
│   ├── calculate_correlation.py
│   └── ...
├── information_retrieval
│   ├── arxiv_download.py
│   ├── arxiv_search.py
│   └── ...
├── math
│   ├── calculate_circle_area_from_diameter.py
│   └── ...
└── tool_description.tsv
```

Tools can be imported from `tools/{category}/{tool_name}.py` with exactly the same tool name.
`tool_description.tsv` contains descriptions of tools for retrieval.

## How Tool Library works
When an agent's description is provided, a retriever will retrieve `top_k` tool candidates from the library based on the semantic
similarity between agent description and tool description. The tool description is same as that in `tool_description.tsv`.

After candidates are retrieved, the agent's system message will be updated with the tool candidates' information and how to call the tools.
A user proxy with the ability to execute the code will be added to the nested chat. Under the hood, this is achieved by leveraging the
[User Defined Functions](/docs/topics/code-execution/user-defined-functions) feature. A `LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor` equipped with all the functions serves as
code executor for the user proxy.

# Building your own Tool Library
Building your own tool library is simple, follow the same directory layout as the one we provided. The python files should be follow the layout `tools/{category}/{tool_name}.py`.
The tool you'd like to add should be imported in the following fashion:

```python
from tools.category.tool_name import tool_name
```

The `tool_description.tsv` file should be a tab-separated file with two columns `docid` and `document_content`. The `document_content` should always follow
the format `"category tool_name tool_description"`. The category and tool_name should always be one word with no space in between. The document_content is
used to calculate semantic similarity for retrieval.

Once your library is ready, specify the path in `nested_config` of CaptainAgent.
```python
nested_config = {
    ...
    "autobuild_tool_config": {
        "tool_root": "Your tool root here",
        "retriever": "all-mpnet-base-v2", # This is the default embedding model, you can reove this line if you are not intending to change it
    },
    ...
}
```

By following these steps, you can easily customize the tools library of CaptainAgent and empower your agents with new tools and capabilities.

## Note on Adding Customized Tools
Due to the implementation of [User Defined Functions](/docs/topics/code-execution/user-defined-functions), when writing your own tool, you need to write your import statement in the function definition. For example, adding an audio transcription tool:

```python
def audio_transcription(audio_file):
    import whisper
    model = whisper.load_model("base")
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)
    return result["text"]
```

There is also decorator `with_requirements` that may become handy for [adding dependencies](/docs/topics/code-execution/user-defined-functions).
